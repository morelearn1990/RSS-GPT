<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Another trick for readers interested in honing their keyboard-fu on macOS.</p>

<p>In Vim, most operations have can have a count specified in the keystrokes for the command, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3dd</code> to delete 3 lines. You can do similar in any Cocoa text field (all Apple apps, plus most native apps). You just need to specify a keyboard shortcut to use before the count. Then you can hit that keyboard shortcut, type a number (X) and then hit a key or key combination to have that event repeated X times.</p>

<p>To set the repeat shortcut:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>defaults write -g NSRepeatCountBinding -string "~r"</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above would set the repeat binding to <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span>. Use the following shortcuts when defining the operator, being sure not to overwrite a keyboard shortcut you use elsewhere (control-option combinations are pretty safe):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Symbol</th>
      <th>Modifier</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>~</td>
      <td>Option</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>@</td>
      <td>Command</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>^</td>
      <td>Control</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$</td>
      <td>Shift</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>You can use any combination of symbols when defining your shortcut. I like <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~r</code>) because it has no conflicts that I know of and is easily reachable with my left hand. Also there’s a mnemonic quality with “r” for “repeat.” Choose whatever you like.</p>

<p>Once the above <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">defaults</code> command is run, relaunch whatever app you want to test it in. It will work in TextEdit, nvUltra, Bear, Pages… most apps that you would use on your Mac. But a restart of the app will be required for the new bindings to be recognized.</p>

<p>Now, type your selected shortcut (<span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span> if you didn’t change it), then type a number (any number of digits), then type “x”. If you typed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;SHORTCUT&gt;10x</code>, you should get <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xxxxxxxxxx</code>. This works with both character insertions and movement keys and text operations. For example, if you type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;SHORTCUT&gt;5</code> and then hit <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-Delete"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9003;</kbd></span>, it would delete backwards 5 words. Each step of the repeat process is stored in the undo buffer, so undoing it would require five <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Z"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Z</kbd></span>s. This is actually a feature, because if you’re estimating how many words back to delete but guess wrong, you can undo a couple to restore them individually.</p>

<p>One niche example use for this is when you want to insert a redacted password or API key when you’re writing. You know the length of the password or key should be 20 characters, so you just type <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">20x</code> and get a string of x’s of the appropriate length. Or if you want to select the previous 3 words in the current line, just type <span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code><span class="keycombo combined" title="Option-Shift-Left Arrow Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8997;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8679;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#8592;</kbd></span>. Much like Vim, it takes a second of thought to figure out how many times you want to repeat an action, and in some cases it’s faster to just hit the key that number of times. But give it a go and make a conscious effort to use it for a while, I bet it will stick.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Weirdly this trick doesn’t work for <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-V"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">V</kbd></span>, which is disappointing because one very common use I could see for it would be to copy something and then paste it X number of times. I can’t explain why that doesn’t work.</p>

<p>So you may have seen my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/keybindings/" title="KeyBindings">KeyBindings</a> project before. It’s an insanely large collection of keybinding tricks that work in any macOS text field. Well, any native cocoa field. You won’t have much luck in Electron or other non-native text editors. But for most uses, including in Safari, Mail, Notes, nvUltra, and most of the Markdown editors, the tricks work great. You can do things like adding TextMate-style <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Return Key"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">&#9166;</kbd></span> to any editor to create a new line no matter where your caret<sup id="fnref:caret"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:caret" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> (cursor) is in the line.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/topic/keybindings/">written a bit about all of this before</a> (and see the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/series/keybinding/">KeyBinding series</a>), but I’ll recap the basics for this tip, since it’s been a while. To wit, you can create a (plain text) file located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> that tells every macOS app what to do when you hit certain keys, and you can override all kinds of defaults and add new functionality by editing it. If that file already exists, you can just add to it. I’ll offer more details when we get to that part of the trick.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="emacs-keybindings">Emacs Keybindings</h3>

<p>You already have emacs-style shortcuts available, including <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-K"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">K</kbd></span> to delete (kill) to end of line, <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-U"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">U</kbd></span> to delete to beginning of line, and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span> to paste (yank) text that was cut using either of the kill commands. You can delete an entire line by hitting <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-A"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">A</kbd></span> (go to beginning of line) and then <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-K"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">K</kbd></span>, then paste that line somewhere else with <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span>. Try it. You don’t have to do anything to enable this, it’s always been built into macOS. I think it also works on iOS, but I don’t have an external keyboard hooked up to test it out with right now. Let me know in the comments.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>Bonus tip: <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-T"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">T</kbd></span> will transpose the characters to the left and right of the caret, allowing you to easily change frutive to furtive with one keystroke.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So this tip is a way to make this cut/paste process more useful. You’ve probably used (or at least seen) clipboard managers before. I use <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar" title="LaunchBar 6">LaunchBar</a> for this, but there are plenty of apps like <a href="https://pasteapp.io/">Paste</a> that can do it. Basically every time you cut or copy something, it gets added to a list in your clipboard manager, allowing you to paste anything you’ve copied elsewhere, rather than just the last thing you copied. I wouldn’t want to function without one. Those apps don’t work with the kill commands, though. So here’s what you can do instead.</p>

<h3 id="create-the-kill-ring">Create the Kill Ring</h3>

<p>First, run this command in Terminal:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>defaults write -g NSTextKillRingSize -int 6</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That creates a “kill ring” with 6 slots. Every time you cut, the text will be stored in the next available slot, cycling back to the beginning when the 6 slots are full. You can make that number anything you want, but be aware that to use items stored in the kill ring, you’ll have to cycle through them until you get to the one you want, and empty slots will still have to be cycled through. Which generally would mean pasting them all in a row, which is where the next part of the trick comes in.</p>

<h3 id="edit-the-keybindings">Edit the Keybindings</h3>

<ol>
  <li>If you already have a file at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code>, open it in a text editor and add the keybinding inside of the main curly brackets that already exist in the file. If you don’t have that file, create a new, empty text file in your text editor of choice.</li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re working with an empty file, first insert a pair of curly brackets before inserting the text below. If you already have an existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> file, then just add the following between the existing parent curly brackets:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>"^y" = (yankAndSelect:);</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Save the file (as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> if it’s new).</li>
  <li>Running apps will need to be restarted to recognize the new keybindings.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this circumstance, “yank” means “paste” from the register, as opposed to the Vim vernacular where it means “copy” (which makes more sense 🤷🏻‍♂️). So now, pressing <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span> (“^y”) will paste the next item from the kill ring, and immediately select it (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yankAndSelect:</code>), so pressing <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span> again will overwrite what you just pasted with the next item in the kill ring. If there are registers in the kill ring that haven’t been filled yet, it will paste an empty string, but you can just keep hitting <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span> to cycle back around to where your populated registers are.</p>

<blockquote class="error">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The kill ring is shared between documents in the same app, but generally not between apps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To try it out, restart your text editor (if it was running when you changed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DefaultKeyBinding.dict</code> file) and write several lines of text in a text field:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>this is line 1
this is line 2
this is line 3
this is line 4</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Put your caret at the beginning of each line and press <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-K"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">K</kbd></span>, once for each line (use arrow keys and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-A"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">A</kbd></span> to get to each line start). Then, put your caret anywhere and type <span class="keycombo combined" title="Control-Y"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8963;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Y</kbd></span> repeatedly. You should see your cut lines pasted and replaced in place. Note that these commands do register in the undo buffer, so if you cycle past the one you wanted, you can usually use <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Z"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Z</kbd></span> to go backwards through the list. The kill ring is <abbr title="Last In First Out">LIFO</abbr>, so you’ll get your results in the reverse order you added them to the ring.</p>

<title>Ruby Regexp::scan with MatchData</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16498512/ruby-regexp-scan-with-matchdata</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16498512/ruby-regexp-scan-with-matchdata</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This post will only be of interest to people writing scripts in Ruby. Seriously, zero utility if you’re not using Ruby. Though I would be curious how you accomplish the same thing in other languages like Rust and Python, because I’ve never gotten too deep with string manipulation in anything other than Ruby, Swift, and Objective-C. If you care to leave a comment with pointers, I’m all ears.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I do a lot of string manipulation in Ruby. One of the things that always gets me is that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Regexp::match</code> method returns groups but only matches the first instance. To match all instances for enumeration, you have to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Regexp::scan</code>. But <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scan</code> doesn’t include groups (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MatchData</code>). So a while back I figured out the solution, and I thought I’d share it for any aspiring Ruby scripters.</p>

<p>The trick is to map scan results and replace each result with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Regexp::last_match</code>, which includes groups (and named groups) from the last regex that was run. Thus:</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="n">str</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">to_enum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:scan</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">regex</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="no">Regexp</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">last_match</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>results in an array of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MatchData</code>. Then you can iterate through it and use indexes or group names to pull out particular groups of each match.</p>

<p>I’ve combined this with a few other methods to create a general string handling routine that I use regularly.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="c1"># frozen_string_literal: true</span>

<p>With the above methods available, you can do something like:</p>

  Slartibartfast &lt;fjordmaster@example.com&gt;
  Marvin the Paranoid Android &lt;planetbrain@example.com&gt;
</span><span class="no">EOEMAILS</span>

<span class="n">rx</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sr">/(?&lt;prefix&gt;\S+\. )?(?&lt;first&gt;.*?)(?:( (?&lt;middle&gt;\w+\.?))*(?: (?&lt;last&gt;[\w-]+)))? &lt;(?&lt;email&gt;.*?)&gt;/i</span>

<p>Running that results in:</p>

<p>That’s a silly example, but hopefully you can see the utility of turning a regular expression into an array of hashes containing the individual values of each match extracted by scanning the string.</p>

  <dd>I haven’t written about tagging for a long time because I felt like, at this point, I’ve convinced everyone who could be convinced about their usefulness. That still appears to be true, but this TidBits article talks a little bit more about the ways people use Finder tags.</dd>

  <dd>You probably know I’m an OmniFocus guy, but I’m always trying the latest in todo apps. This one bills itself as “a todo app for people who hate todo apps,” and it looks pretty great for exactly those people. “Works just like Notes, with smarts of a calendar.”</dd>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SpamSieve gives you back your inbox, using powerful Bayesian spam filtering to provide amazing accuracy that’s constantly improving. Works with IMAP, Exchange, and POP mail accounts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I decided to make a “Brett’s Favorites 2023” part 2. I missed a few things in the first list. This will be a shorter post, but should cover some gaps I left in <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/12/08/bretts-favorites-2023/">the first one</a>.</p>

<h3 id="apps-i-missed">Apps I Missed</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://timingapp.com/" title="Timing Automatic Mac Time Tracker">Timing</a></dt>
  <dd>I use Timing every day for keeping track of how I spend my time on my computer (and my iPhone). When I start a new project, at the end of the day I open up the main window and add rules by dragging and dropping relevant files and keywords, so time spend on that project is automatically tracked moving forward. I even made <a href="https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/doing/2.1.84/Doing/TimingImport" title="www.rubydoc.info">an importer</a> for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/" title="doing - BrettTerpstra.com">Doing</a> that combines my time tracking with my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">What Was I Doing?</code> file.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://noteplan.co/" title="noteplan.co">Noteplan</a></dt>
  <dd>I got back into Noteplan in the latter half of 2023. I love the idea of combining my notes and brainstorming with scheduling, todos, and time blocking. All using Markdown. It’s a beautiful idea and superbly executed.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="a-little-fiction">A Little Fiction</h3>

<p>I read a ton in 2023, mostly via audiobooks. So “read” might be a stretch, but I do love audiobooks. I won’t list everything I’ve read here, but a couple of standouts:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1941539416/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="Flux by Jeremy Robinson">Flux by Jeremy Robinson</a></dt>
  <dd>I read so many books from Jeremy Robinson this year. He weaves excellent sci-fi stories. Also check out <a href="https://amzn.to/3GAM6Py">Infinite</a>. The twists are insidiously satisfying.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3uSAIMx">In the lives of Puppets by TJ Klune</a></dt>
  <dd>There’s a space for queer Sci-Fi, and TJ Klune does an amazing job of occupying it. This book takes the idea of a future dominated by robots and few (one?) remaining human and makes it a truly heartwarming journey. Thanks to Jesse Darst for cluing me into this one.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="therapuetic">Therapuetic</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1683646681/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="No-Bad-Parts-Restoring-Wholeness">No Bad Parts by Richard C. Schwartz</a></dt>
  <dd>I’ve been doing a lot of therapy this year and only recently discovered Internal Family Systems, which has been a game changer. I won’t explain the psychology of it here, but if you want to learn more about the parts of you that might prevent you from being your true self, definitely check this out. I bought the e-book version for my Kindle, but also bought the audiobook version for its guided meditations.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/47MjoHq">What My Bones Know: A Memoir of Healing from Complex Trauma</a></dt>
  <dd>This was the year I realized I had Complex PTSD, and I did a lot of reading around it. This one serves more as a memoir than a treatment plan, so take it along with some actual therapy. A lot of hope here, though.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://overtiredpod.com/">Overtired</a></dt>
  <dd>The Mental Health Corner on Overtired means a lot to me. I get to share my journey through CPTSD, ADHD, and Bipolar, as well as hear from people who go through very similar things to me. It’s kind of its own version of therapy (though it can’t replace actual therapy.) If you have issues of your own, you’ll probably be able to relate to me, Christina, and Jeff as we share. I recommend checking it out.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="kitchen">Kitchen</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/487Xluz">The Wicked Healthy Cookbook</a></dt>
  <dd>If you’re vegan or aspiring to be, this book is a must-have. Truly delicious food and techniques that even a non-vegan can appreciate. I’m pescatarian for the time being, but cooking without meat, dairy, or (in my case) gluten means I’m always looking for recipes that actually taste amazing but fit my diet.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3taVJBw">The Vegan Chinese Kitchen</a></dt>
  <dd>I’ve been into Chinese cooking lately, and it’s pretty easy to make it vegan. I also recommend <a href="https://yeungmancooking.com/products/yeung-man-cooking-cookbook-signed">Yeung Man Cooking</a> (also available as <a href="https://yeungmancooking.com/products/yeung-man-cooking-cookbook-ebook">a digital version</a> for $20), and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@YEUNGMANCOOKING">the author has a YouTube channel</a> worth checking out.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://misen.com/products/pre-seasoned-carbon-steel-pan">Misen Carbon Steel Pans</a></dt>
  <dd>I have been through countless non-stick pan solutions over the years. I long for the convenience, but nothing seemed to stand the test of time. Our trusty cast iron pan outlasted all of them by miles, and with <a href="https://amzn.to/3Gz96OW">a good chain mail scrubber</a><sup id="fnref:chainmail"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:chainmail" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, they’re very easy to care for. Then I tried carbon steel pans and have decided that that’s the way forward. They become more non-stick over time as a a natural result of material and seasoning, rather than quickly losing some chemical coating and becoming a stickier mess than your typical aluminum pan. I admit I’m awful at properly caring for non-stick pans, which is why I needed a solution that just got better the more you used it (and could handle high heats). Misen has always impressed me, and their carbon steel pans have proven to be an excellent solution.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://store.177milkstreet.com/products/milk-street-nakiri">Milk Street Nakiri</a></dt>
  <dd>My favorite chef’s knife is still <a href="https://amzn.to/3Nh8Fg3">my Misen</a>, but this “vegetable knife” is pretty amazing. It’s a great form factor, and I love it. If you want to spend about half as much, there are <a href="https://amzn.to/4acfs4s">plenty of similar options</a>. I can vouch for the Milk Street one, though. Lightweight, sharp, textured blade for gripping between thumb and forefinger.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3GC0HdK">Tumbler Diamond Rolling Knife Sharpener</a></dt>
  <dd>I <em>love</em> a sharp kitchen knife, but have never been great at sharpening myself or sending my knives off for professional sharpening. That’s why I jumped on this when I discovered it, and it’s been 100% worth the investment. Definitely get <a href="https://www.tumblerware.com/collections/all/products/tumbler-leather-strop">the strop</a>, too.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="other-hardware">Other Hardware</h3>

<p>I said I didn’t buy a lot of hardware this year, but I dug through my Amazon purchases and found the stuff that I actually love.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3t87M2y">Elgato Stream Deck Pedal</a></dt>
  <dd>I’m all in on Elgato stuff, from my <a href="https://amzn.to/3Nf4VvC">Wave XLR</a> to my multiple <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXHL5DMD/?ref=as_li_ss_tl&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=bretttercom-20" title="Elgato-Production-Controller-Streaming-Customizable">Stream Decks</a>. But what was missing was buttons for my feet, and the Stream Deck Pedal has filled that gap nicely. I tried a few other, cheaper USB pedal solutions before I gave in and purchased this, and I’ll tell you that nothing else works as well. Whether you need a cough button, control over your Twitch stream lighting, or just want to be able to launch an automation with your foot, it’s a lot of fun.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3GArAic">Minoston Z-Wave Outlet Mini Plug-in Socket</a></dt>
  <dd>I’m only dipping my toes in Homekit, with a lot of hope for Matter, but for now my home automation is mostly Insteon and Z-Wave. These little plugs have made automating the Christmas lights I use for warming up various rooms super easy.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://amzn.to/3Rgk94n">Tineco Pure ONE S15 Pet Smart Cordless Vacuum Cleaner</a></dt>
  <dd>I was a big fan of Dyson stick vacuums, but they kept breaking on me. Too much maintenance. So I decided to try something new. This one has been excellent. I’ve been using it for about 6 months and have only had to clean it once. Plus I love/hate the little headlight it has on it; I love it because it helps me see all the grit I’m picking up, but I hate it because it makes it obvious when I’m going too fast.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:chainmail">
      <p>Wait, you didn’t know about chain mail? You can scrub the living hell out of a cast iron (or carbon steel) pan with chain mail and it won’t destroy the seasoning or cause any rusting. If you like heavy cookware, you need one of these. Do <strong><em>not</em></strong> use it on a non-stick pan. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:chainmail">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Welcome to my yearly post about stuff I’ve loved in the last year. I love doing this because it reminds me how amazing the Mac/iOS app ecosystem is these days. I can’t list every app I use in this post, it would take forever, but I can highlight some of the outstanding ones. I’m going to do this all in one epic post this year. It’s going to get long. You could always use <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/gather-cli/" title="Gather CLI">Gather</a> to convert it to Markdown, and then make use of all of <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked’s</a> navigation tools 😇.</p>

<p>Apps available on <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a> will be noted. As I mention frequently, Setapp is a great deal at $10/month for 200+ excellent apps. If you’re a Setapp user, you should always try to use the Setapp version of your favorite apps to make sure the developer gets a piece of your subscription! If you’re not, you should seriously consider signing up. <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">This link</a> gives me a little kickback when you join!</p>

<p>The categories are presented with items in no particular order. I could have made them alphabetical, or attempted to rank them, but no, I present you with an unorganized stream of consciousness. Welcome to the inside of my head.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="the-old-but-awesome-stuff">The Old But Awesome Stuff</h3>

<p>I’m going to quickly list some repeats that are still favorites here at the top. These are apps I’ve used for years and still rely on every day, but I’ve talked about them plenty and you’ve probably heard about them before. So just a quick list of my perennial favorites.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.houdah.com/houdahSpot/" title="Powerful File Search Tool for Mac">HoudahSpot</a></dt>
  <dd>Find everything on your Mac, even the stuff that Spotlight misses.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.toketaware.com/" title="toketaWare">iThoughtsX</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>My favorite mind mapping tool. All the power and flexibility you need without becoming a chore to use. This one is on the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/giveaways/upcoming/">giveaway list</a>, so stay tuned for that next year!</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.zengobi.com/curio/" title="Note Taking, Mind Mapping, Brainstorming">Curio</a></dt>
  <dd>The ever-evolving brainstorming/project management tool that continues to amaze. Watch for a giveaway coming soon (New Year’s Day!).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://1password.com/downloads/" title="Best Password Manager for Apple iOS Devices">1Password</a></dt>
  <dd>With the new Passkey and Authenticator possibilities in 1Password, it’s a no-brainer for me. I’ve trusted it for years and it’s never let me down.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://folivora.ai/" title="folivora.ai-Great Tools for your Mac!">BetterTouchTool</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I talk about BetterTouchTool all the time. Maybe too much. But it’s the most amazing automation tool I’ve found. Second place for me is <a href="http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/" title="Keyboard Maestro 11.0.2:Work Faster with Macros for macOS">Keyboard Maestro</a>, which just got a new version (v11) in the last few months.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://freron.com/" title="MailMate">MailMate</a></dt>
  <dd>The stalwart email app for Mac that I depend on. Customizable shortcut keys, plugin architecture, Markdown capabilities… I’ve never found anything close.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://choosy.app/" title="Choosy:A smarter default browser for macOS">Choosy</a></dt>
  <dd>Choosy is long in the tooth but still working great. Instead of opening a link in your default browser, you can pop up a selection of any browser on your system, and you can create rules for handling different types of links with specific browsers.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/" title="Simply Useful Software">Hazel</a></dt>
  <dd>I use Hazel every day, but I don’t even think about it most of the time. It just sits in the background, managing my files and doing crazy automations when I give a file a certain naming pattern or put it in a certain folder. For example, if I save an image to my desktop with a name like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brettsfavorites2023@2x%%r1600ohc.png</code>, Hazel will (r)esize it to 1600px width, (c)onvert it to JPEG, create a (h)alf-size 1x version, and (o)ptimize the images. Then I just drag the results to a <a href="https://aptonic.com/" title="Aptonic-Dropzone 4">Dropzone</a> target to have them added to my blog and an image tag for the pair placed in my clipboard.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.macbartender.com/" title="Take control of your Menu bar">Bartender</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>Without Bartender my menu bar would be out of control. But with it, I can hide all of the menu bar icons I don’t need all of the time, and quickly access them with a hotkey search.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/" title="www.stclairsoft.com">Default Folder X</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>Early in the Sonoma release DFX stopped working for me (all fixed now), and I didn’t realize exactly how dependent on it I was until it wasn’t there anymore. Save and open dialogs on your Mac need this.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.popclip.app/" title="PopClip for Mac">PopClip</a></dt>
  <dd>I use PopClip all day, every day. It pops up a menu every time you select text with your mouse. The available extensions are outstanding, and I have my own <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/bretts-popclip-extensions/" title="Brett's PopClip Extensions">custom actions</a>, too. One example is my URL Preview extension, so when I use SearchLink to grab a URL for an app I’m writing about but I’m not sure the result is correct, I just select the url and click the preview button in the popup. I get a tiny little web browser floating over my text, and if it’s the correct link, I hit escape and go back to writing.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://textexpander.com/" title="TextExpander:#1 Text Replacement &amp; Keyboard Shortcut App">TextExpander</a></dt>
  <dd>You hear about TextExpander every month when they sponsor this blog, so it makes this quicker list. It’s another app that, on the occasion it stops working, so do I. I don’t even remember how to type some of the things it makes automatic for me. One example is sending nvUltra beta invites. I just hit <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span> to reply to an email request, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,,nvub</code>, and have an email with all of the necessary links and info ready to send. Or I can generate a new license for <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a> by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,,mlic</code>, and TextExpander will use the Paddle API to make me a license and insert all of the text I would send to explain how to use it. And I just linked that reference to Marked by typing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/m</code>. Infinite possibilities.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.taskpaper.com/" title="www.taskpaper.com/">TaskPaper</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I have a TaskPaper file in every project folder, and I use tools like <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code></a> to quickly manage them from the command line. But nothing beats opening up the actual TaskPaper app for speedy task management and ease of use with lots of keyboard shortcuts.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://hookproductivity.com/" title="Links beat searching">Hookmark</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I’ve preached the Hookmark gospel a lot here. Their recent improvements to the “bookmarking” concept (plus the Pinboard integration) have made this an invaluable tool for keeping my projects together. I have this post linked to a few web pages, my nvUltra notes on it, and the Markdown versions of previous installments of my Favorites series for reference. I just hit my shortcut key and navigate between them with ease.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="newish-stuff">New(ish) Stuff</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus" title="Task Management Software Built For Pros-OmniFocus">OmniFocus 4</a></dt>
  <dd>The latest version of OmniFocus is a major revamp of the app. I don’t think it will be available in time for this post to go up, but let me at least tease it by saying if you love OmniFocus already, you’re going to love v4, and if you’ve disliked it in the past for any reason, it’s time to give it another look. An honorary mention here goes to <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/" title="To-Do List for Mac &amp; iOS">Things</a> — the latest version is a top-notch app, especially if OmniFocus just feels more powerful than you need.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.corecode.io/macupdater/" title="keep all your apps up-to-date effortlessly">MacUpdater</a></dt>
  <dd>This app has quickly become one of my day-to-day favorites. It keeps all of my apps up-to-date without me having to deal with download/install prompts every time I launch them. See the release notes for an update if you want to, install available updates with a single click, and always have the latest and greatest versions of apps ready to run. It auto-scans for updates in the background, so you don’t even have to remember to check it to keep everything updated.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://tapbots.com/ivory/" title="Ivory for iOS">Ivory</a></dt>
  <dd>I’m all in on Mastodon, and all out on Twitter. And Ivory is my favorite Mastodon client on both Mac and iOS. It does everything I need it to, beautifully. If you ever enjoyed TweetBot, this is kind of that, but for Mastodon.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://tailscale.com/download" title="Download">Tailscale</a></dt>
  <dd>What a great tool. I hook it up to my GitHub account and then every device on my network is accessible through a private VPN from anywhere in the world. I have it running on all of my Macs, my iPad, and my Synology, and I can get direct access to any device without any additional hassle.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://kaleidoscope.app/" title="Git Diff and Merge Tool and Text Comparison—Kaleidoscope">Kaleidoscope</a></dt>
  <dd>Kaleidoscope has made huge bounds in functionality this year. It was already my diff tool of choice (on any platform), but they’ve added new integrations, debugging features, and awesome support for Git history and merging. (Full disclosure, Kaleidoscope has sponsored this blog. This opinion is unpaid!)</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.descript.com/tools/transcription" title="Reliable, Simple &amp; Free Video &amp; Audio Transcriptions">Descript</a></dt>
  <dd>I can’t imagine making podcasts without Descript anymore. It does fairly reliable transcriptions, but the real magic is that you can edit the podcast by editing the text of the transcription. Makes it easy to search for parts you remember need an edit, remove filler words, and add things like chapter titles and cover art to make a ready-to-publish MP3.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://appmakes.io/paletro" title="Command Palette in any applications">Paletro</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I think I’ve mentioned this one before, but if you like command palettes in your favorite editor (e.g. <span class="keycombo combined" title="Shift-Command-P"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8679;</kbd><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">P</kbd></span> in Sublime), this adds the same concept to any app on your Mac. Hit the keyboard shortcut and every menu item (including Quick Actions and Services) are instantly available via keyboard.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screens-5-vnc-remote-desktop/id1663047912">Screens</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I use Screens all the time for connecting to my various Macs, especially the mini that runs headless in my basement. Versus the Screen Sharing tools in macOS, it adds Screens Connect, which helps you connect to known machines from anywhere, stored credentials, and curtain mode, which masks the display of the remote Mac you connect to. Clipboard sharing, display selection (when there are multiple montiors), and easy drag-and-drop file transfers make it a pretty seamless experience.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://sindresorhus.com/dato" title="Dato — Sindre Sorhus">Dato</a></dt>
  <dd>I can’t use <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical" title="flexibits.com">Fantastical</a> with my work calendar, unfortunately (if I could, I’d be using that). But Dato works with my calendar, shows a great summary of calendar events in my menu bar, and makes joining a Zoom call a one-click process from either the menu bar or the notifications it provides. Solid tool that I use daily.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/" title="award-winning photo editing software">Affinity Photo</a></dt>
  <dd>The Affinity apps continue to blow me away, and I use Affinity Photo almost daily. It completely replaced Photoshop for me a couple of years ago. Honorable mentions to <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/acorn/" title="Full Featured Photo Editor for the Mac">Acorn</a> and <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/" title="Retrobatch 2, from Flying Meat">RetroBatch</a> from Flying Meat for regularly helping me with my image processing.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://iterm2.com/" title="macOS Terminal Replacement">iTerm</a></dt>
  <dd>I’ve tried all the terminal apps that have been popping up. <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" title="Warp:Your terminal, reimagined">Warp</a> is great, for sure. But I always come back to iTerm. It got so many of the special features right that it feels like all the other developers are just trying to keep up with it.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/" title="Loopback:Cable-Free Audio Routing">Loopback</a></dt>
  <dd>I love Rogue Amoeba (also a previous sponsor), and Loopback is an amazing tool for audio routing. If you, like me, have multiple audio inputs and outputs, it makes creating virtual devices for them (or any combination of them) a drag-and-drop affair. For example, I use my Echo Dot for playing Spotify music, and route it through my Komplete 6 as a secondary input. I created a Loopback device that combines that secondary input with my main computer audio and adds the ability to mute the device using the media keys.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/" title="Structured &amp; focused writing app for Mac">Bike</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>Bike is a new entrant this year. I generally think in mind maps, but there’s always a place for a solid outliner. I used to use Tree, but it fell into disrepair, and Bike is coming along nicely. As you would expect from Hog Bay Software, the query tools and automation capabilities are receiving lots of love. Plus the file format is just text (HTML, to be precise) and your outlines can be used anywhere. Much like TaskPaper, it’s easy to automate using command line tools, but more fun to work with inside the app.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://retina.studio/textbuddy/" title="TextBuddy">TextBuddy</a></dt>
  <dd>I love TextBuddy so much. It does everything you want to do with text, from wrapping/unwrapping, escaping, translating, converting tabs to spaces, even reading text from images and working with it. And it does it elegantly with keyboard shortcuts. No buttons to hit, just paste your text (or send it via Service shortcut), hit <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-T"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">T</kbd></span> and type to find the conversion you want to run. It’s even extensible with JavaScript, and can also run your favorite Services (like <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a>!).</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://devutils.com/" title="DevUtils-All-in-one Toolbox for Developers">DevUtils</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>This is another new one to me. It’s a collection of simple tools a developer would make use of, such as url encoding, JSON formatting/validation, JSON/YAML conversion, Unix Time converter, and dozens of others. It can detect what type of data is on your clipboard when you click its menu bar icon, offering an accurate guess of which tool(s) you’ll need to handle it. It can also copy straight back to clipboard, so some things are simply a matter of copying text, clicking the icon (global and Service shortcuts available), and pasting the result.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.git-tower.com/" title="The most powerful Git client for Mac and Windows">Tower</a></dt>
  <dd>I’ve mentioned Tower before (also a previous sponsor), but it’s come a long way this year. One of the most ingenious features is the undo command (<span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-Z"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">Z</kbd></span>) that can undo literally any Git operation. You know, the ones that usually require filtering through the reflog and making cherry pick commits to fix. It makes using Git a pleasure, and taps into all of the powerful features it offers, just with drag and drop instead of command line futzing.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://cleanshot.com/" title="CleanShot X for Mac">CleanShot X</a> <a class="setapplink" href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a></dt>
  <dd>I mentioned this one last year, but I would be remiss not to let you know how much I love it again. CleanShot X is one of the most useful and elegant utilities on the Mac right now. For all your screenshot needs, including things like automatic email pixelation and annotation, it just can’t be beat.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="ios">iOS</h3>

<p>I haven’t found a lot of new stuff on iOS that I love this last year, but mostly because I primarily use my phone for email, messaging, and gaming. There are a few standouts in my daily use, though.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spark-mail-ai-email-inbox/id997102246?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Spark Mail + AI: Email Inbox">Spark</a></dt>
  <dd>Spark gets a mention as my favorite email client. I haven’t sprung for the premium features, I find that the base package does everything I need it to. Smart inbox, easily configured sidebar, snoozing, pinning, and great search. Combined with <a href="https://try.sanebox.com/ttscoff" title="SaneBox—Email Management for Any Inbox">SaneBox</a> (sponsor) and MailMate on my Mac, I’m quite happy with my email management system.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finity/id1071698434?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="finity.">Finity</a></dt>
  <dd>Rabbi Eric Linder introduced me to this game and it did the impossible task of replacing Threes, my all-time favorite waiting room game. It’s an infinite puzzle that you’ll never beat, but it’s so much fun to play.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/grindstone/id1357426636?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Grindstone">Grindstone</a></dt>
  <dd>Grindstone is still one of my favorite games. Even though I’ve 3-starred all the levels, they offer daily challenges with worldwide leaderboards that keep me coming back.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/artifact-feed-your-curiosity/id1572927568?uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink" title="Artifact: Feed Your Curiosity">Artifact</a></dt>
  <dd>Apple News hasn’t impressed me that much lately, but Artifact is a constant source of headlines I actually care about, across multiple categories. And the AI-generated summaries are great. It will even rewrite headlines to be less click-baity if enough people report them.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/night-vision-lidar-scanner/id1668629667" title="Night Vision - LiDAR Scanner">Night Vision</a></dt>
  <dd>I don’t use this app as often as the others, but I like the concept. It makes your iPhone’s LiDAR camera available as a kind of night vision camera, allowing you to see objects in complete darkness. Handy for stumbling through the house at night when you can’t sleep but don’t want to wake anybody up.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>I apparently didn’t buy much other hardware this year, and my list is pretty much exactly the same as last year’s. <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2022/12/31/bretts-favorites-2022-hardware/">Check it out here.</a> I will mention my UHK, though:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/" title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard-The keyboard. For professionals.">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard</a></dt>
  <dd>My perennial favorite keyboard, and I got the V2 this year with box white switches, wooden wrist rests, and the new thumb modules. I’ve gotten a few other people on board with this one and haven’t heard about anybody being disappointed with the purchase. I’m typing on it right now and loving it. UHK recently released the <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/product/riser60">Riser 60</a>, a mechanism for getting steeper tenting (two halves raised in the middle). Ordered mine immediately, just waiting for it to ship!</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="personal-projects">Personal Projects</h3>

<p>I did a lot of coding this year. My bipolar has been stable for the last 6 months, so I’m taking a healthier-than-usual approach to coding. No all-night coding binges, just steady improvements of some of my favorite tools.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a></dt>
  <dd>SearchLink is a child who takes care of me in my old age. I put a lot of love into it, and it works to make my life easier. If you haven’t seen it, it makes writing a post like this one a cinch. I haven’t switched over to my browser once since I started writing. I just give it text like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Kaleidoscope](!s +mac)</code> and hit the keyboard shortcut, and it inserts a link (with title attribute) to the app in question. Works for dozens of search types. I recently added back <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/11/05/searchlink-gets-google-search-back/">Google searching using the API</a> (as opposed to scraping DuckDuckGO, though that’s still available), and my results are 99% correct on the first try.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com">NA (Next Action)</a></dt>
  <dd>I made a lot of progress on NA this year, converting it to a gem, adding the ability to update and modify tasks, and improving overall performance. As I mentioned above, I use TaskPaper-formatted files in every one of my projects to track bugs, todos, and feature requests, and NA makes working with those files from the command line easy and fun.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://marked2app.com/" title="Smarter tools for smarter writers">Marked 2</a></dt>
  <dd>Marked didn’t see as much innovation as usual this last year, but it continues to do what it does very well: previewing Markdown and exporting HTML and beautiful PDFs. Multi-document features, writing tools, regex searching, bookmarking in long documents… it does it all. The biggest challenge this year was updating for Sonoma, which broke significant parts of Marked.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://bunchapp.co">Bunch</a></dt>
  <dd>Bunch got a ton of love early this year. It’s been stable for a few months now, almost every feature request handled and all bugs squashed (that were squashable). It’s received coverage on multiple sites and even print write-ups in  a couple of magazines. I’m pretty proud of it as a project, and think it fits nicely into the Mac automation space.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">mdless</a></dt>
  <dd>mdless was my most recent coding obsession, and probably my last one for the year. It previews Markdown on the command line, outputting formatted text to your terminal. Perfect for reading those README files after you clone a project! Combined with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/gather-cli/" title="Gather CLI">Gather</a> (a previous coding obsession this year), it can actually work as a Lynx-style browser.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://nvultra.com/" title="nvUltra-Searchable, portable, MultiMarkdown notes">nvUltra</a></dt>
  <dd>I know, I know. It’s so close. The beta is very, very stable, we’re just working on a couple of refinements (and some MAS purchase issues) before release. If you’re reading this and you’re not on the beta already, <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/contact/">contact me</a> to get added.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Well, that’s my wrap-up for 2023. Hopefully you found some gems along the way. If you have apps you think I should check out, please come tell me about them <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com/">in the forum</a>!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thanks to Backblaze for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! I’ve been a user for years and it’s saved my hide many times.

<title>mdless with document transclusion</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16484987/mdless-with-document-transclusion</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16484987/mdless-with-document-transclusion</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The latest version of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">mdless</a>, my most recent coding obsession, now includes MultiMarkdown <a href="https://fletcher.github.io/MultiMarkdown-5/transclusion.html">document transclusion</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>File transclusion is the ability to tell MultiMarkdown to insert the contents of another file inside the current file being processed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can include a document by inserting a relative path between two pairs of curly brackets:</p>

<p>The path is relative to the current document, which won’t work if you’re piping text to mdless. In that case it would need to be an absolute path, or have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transclude base</code> specified in the metadata.</p>

<p>To provide a base for transclusion paths, just add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transclude base</code> to your document’s metadata, either as MultiMarkdown metadata, or as a YAML header:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>transclude base: ~/Documents/myproject/chapters</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s probably not a super useful feature to 90% of mdless users, but should be handy for some.</p>

<title>mdless gets all the colors</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16477495/mdless-gets-all-the-colors</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16477495/mdless-gets-all-the-colors</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I just pushed v2.1.6 of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless, terminal markdown viewer">mdless</a>. Once all these 2.0 changes are confirmed to be stable, I’ll let this project go for a while, but right now there’s lots to improve on and I’m enjoying it as a way to blow off steam.</p>

<p>The biggest change in 2.1.6 is the ability to use hex codes when theming. If you didn’t know, the first time <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mdless</code> is run, it saves a theme file to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/mdless/mdless.theme</code>. You can <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/#customization">edit this file</a> to change what colors different elements display as. You can also create additional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NAME.theme</code> files and trigger them with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--theme NAME</code>, or set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:theme:</code> setting in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/mdless/config.yml</code>.</p>

<p>With the latest version, you can use 3 or 6-digit RGB codes in addition to color names. Where previously you were limited to the default ANSI colors like red, blue, magenta, cyan, etc., you can now insert something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eccc87</code> where a color name would usually go. You can affect background colors by prefixing with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bg</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">on_</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bgeccc87</code>. The depth of color that can be displayed depends on your terminal, but at minimum this opens up 256 colors for theming, a 32x increase in options.</p>

<p>I also fixed a couple of issues where span elements in list items would cause the coloration to change. And when there’s a space between list items, they get rendered as paragraphs <em>within</em> list items (standard for most Markdown parsers), causing the coloring to be unexpectedly the same as regular paragraphs. Now <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mdless</code> strips out regular paragraph coloring on paragraphs contained in list items, so every paragraph within a list gets the list item coloring.</p>

<p>In TaskPaper rendering, documents will now respond to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--list</code> to list projects, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--section</code> to list just certain project(s) contents. These no longer have to be numeric (for Markdown or TaskPaper); fuzzy text matching can pick a section (or multiple sections) for you. I also improved the TaskPaper auto-detection by adding a routine that removes all lines that match project or task regular expressions, and if there’s nothing left, it assumes it’s a TaskPaper document. Let me know how this works in the real world.</p>

<p>Lastly, I added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--changes</code> flag that will display the changelog (using mdless for readability), so when you update you can see what changed just by running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mdless --changes</code>.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless, terminal markdown viewer">project page</a> for the full changelog and more details!</p>

<title>SaneBox giveaway surprise!</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thanks to SaneBox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! Instead of a monthly sponsored post this month, the good folks at SaneBox have decided to join my giveaway series and offer 5 free 1-year subscriptions to SaneBox to BrettTerpstra.com readers. Just sign up below for a chance to win.</p>

<p><a href="https://try.sanebox.com/ttscoff" rel="nofollow">
              <noscript class="loading-lazy">

              </noscript>
            </a></p>

<p>If you somehow haven’t heard of SaneBox yet, it’s a service that keeps your email inbox clean. You can train certain types of emails to go to your @SaneLater folder, or any custom folder, just by moving an email once. Future emails like it will automatically go to that folder. Forget setting up complicated filters and rules, a week of training and you’ll have a clean inbox that contains only the messages you actually need to see. I especially love the @SaneBlackHole feature which lets me banish certain senders to a, well, black hole, where their messages disappear and I don’t have to go through any hassle of unsubscribing or requesting data removal to stop the incoming messages.</p>

<p>Sign up below for a chance at one of 5 1-year subscriptions, a $299 value. Winners will be drawn next Wednesday, December 6th.</p>

<p>I made a few major updates to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/">mdless</a> 2.0 (<a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/11/23/mdless-2-dot-0/">first announced a couple days ago</a>) over the holiday weekend. Note that you can make all of the new options permanent in the config file (see <a href="https://brettterpstra.com#updateconfig">Easily Update Config</a>). Options specified on the command line will always override anything in the config file, so you can disable options permanently but enable them on a per-run basis using command line flags.</p>

<h3 id="inline-styling">Inline Styling</h3>

<p>The first problem I ran into was that if a link, emphasis, or other inline element came in the middle of a line, everything after that element would fail to be styled. So I added in a routine that I created for Doing that can take the text preceding an element and determine what the escape sequence would be at the end of that text, right before the new element. Then I can restore that sequence after the new element.</p>

<h3 id="nested-lists">Nested Lists</h3>

<p>Second, and this was a real pain, nested lists weren’t working. Like at all. I didn’t notice it at first because my test files had very basic lists in them, but lists were being flattened, ordered list sequencing was completely out of whack, and nested paragraphs and code blocks within lists were getting totally borked. Fixing this was a pain. Redcarpet only provides “text” and “type” to the list rendering functions, so you have no idea if it’s nested, at what level, etc. You can start a class variable counter and increment it with each ordered item, but as soon as it nests or starts a new list, you’re in trouble, and lists aren’t rendered in sequence anyway, so an array structure to keep track of them is impossible. They’re rendered inside out, so any kind of basic counter will be off as soon as you have a nested ordered list. Fixing this took me three days, and I went through a dozen solutions before one worked. I think the current solution is pretty solid, seems to handle all of the aforementioned issues and maintain accurate numbering with multiple nested, ordered lists. Also indents paragraphs and code blocks within lists.</p>

<p>I am running into an issue where a numbered item can sometimes have an unnecessary line break after it. I haven’t yet been able to track down where that’s coming from. Also, nested code blocks are indented, but one less indent than their parent list item. These will be fixed in future releases.</p>

<h3 id="taskpaper-highlighting">TaskPaper highlighting</h3>

<p>I also added TaskPaper highlighting to mdless. You can run it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--taskpaper true</code> to force TaskPaper highlighting, or run it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--taskpaper auto</code> to detect TaskPaper formatting either from the file extension or test whether it has at least 1 project and 6 total tasks between projects based on regular expressions. Not the most elegant way to detect it, I’m sure, but it seems to work well in my testing. You can add:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="s">:taskpaper: :auto</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/mdless/config.yml</code> to make auto a permanent setting (or use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> to force it either way).</p>

<p>If TaskPaper highlighting is enabled, no other Markdown processing will be done. TaskPaper formatting intersects with Markdown formatting in ways that can cause unpredictable results. So @tags and values are highlighted, project names are highlighted, and task markers get colored. Other than that, it’s just displayed as is.</p>

<h3 id="reference-link-formatting">Reference Link Formatting</h3>

<p>As mentioned in an update to the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/11/23/mdless-2-dot-0/">2.0 announcement</a>, mdless can now render links as inline, reference, or reference-per-paragraph, grouping the references below the paragraph or element that refers to them. Just run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--links paragraph</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--links reference</code> to enable either, and these can be made permanent in the config file by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:links: :reference</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:inline</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:paragraph</code>).</p>

<h3 id="emphasis-markers">Emphasis Markers</h3>

<p>The initial release hid the markers around emphasis, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**bold**</code> would just render as <strong>bold</strong>, applying colors from your theme but leaving out the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">**</code> surrounding it. That’s now configurable in the theme settings:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>emphasis:
  bold: b
  bold_character: "**"
  italic: u i
  italic_character: "_"
  bold-italic: b u i</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can leave the character settings empty to not display any characters at all (as per previous behavior).</p>

<h3 id="other-markdown-rendering-options">Other Markdown Rendering Options</h3>

<p>Redcarpet has flags available for lax spacing (requiring newlines around HTML blocks) and intra-emphasis (where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a_underscored_filename</code> would get rendered with italics in the middle). Disabling intra-emphasis means that underscored filenames (and other words) stay as is.</p>

<p>These can be implemented in mdless using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--[no-]intra-emphasis</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--[no-]lax-spacing</code>, and both options can be made permanent in the config file.</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="s">:lax_spacing: </span><span class="no">true</span>
<span class="s">:intra_emphasis: </span><span class="no">false</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="wiki-links">Wiki Links</h3>

<p>This one is simple, I just added highlighting for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[wiki links]]</code>. It can be toggled with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--[no-]wiki-links</code> and uses the colors specified for link brackets and link text. Make it permanent with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:wiki_links: true</code>.</p>

<h3 id="updateconfig">Easily Update Config</h3>

<p>By the way, you can overwrite the config file with current command line flags and any new keys that have been added by running with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--update-config</code>. Any other flags on the command line will be set in the config, and any new keys that may have been added since your config file was created will be added with their default values.</p>

<p>The config file is found at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/mdless/config.yml</code>. Options specified there can be overridden by using command line flags at any time. This file is automatically written on the first run where the file doesn’t exist, so you can scrap preferences and start again just by deleting the file and running mdless (any command line options used on that first run will be set in the config file, otherwise the default value for each option will be used).</p>

<h3 id="other-stuff">Other Stuff</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pad numbers on headline listing to preserve indentation</li>
  <li>Image rendering with chafa improved, still have to figure out a way to make sure content breaks properly around the embedded image</li>
  <li>Only detect mmd headers on first line</li>
  <li>Scrub invalid UTF-8 in document to remove characters that break regexes</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve updated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mdless</code> to 2.0. Well, 2.0.5 at this point. It’s a complete overhaul of <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">the command line Markdown parser/viewer</a>.</p>

<p>It’s been a pretty popular project, and is being used on all kinds of OSs, but it got frustrating as the whole thing was based on regular expressions for parsing and users expected it to handle some more complex markup than it could. So for the reboot, I switched to using <a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">RedCarpet</a> for parsing, then added my own terminal handling to that via a custom renderer and pre/post processing.</p>

<p>Table cleanup is better than ever. Footnotes can still be displayed directly after the paragraph that references them, or at the end of the display. Code highlighting (with <a href="https://pygments.org/" title="Welcome!—Pygments">Pygments</a>) is more accurate than ever. Ordered lists are properly numbered, regardless of the numbering in the Markdown. There are a few differences in the way things like code blocks nested in lists are displayed (they’re no longer indented), but overall it’s a big step up.</p>

<p>If you’re into Markdown and spend time in the Terminal, let <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mdless</code> display those README files for you, rather than opening up a <a href="https://marked2app.com">dedicated viewer</a> or editor with a preview. See <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">the project page</a> for more details and installation instructions.</p>

<p>Review versions of text and image files—and even folders full of files—with the world’s most powerful file comparison app. <a href="https://kaleidoscope.app">Kaleidoscope</a> gives you powerful tools to use at each stage of the development cycle.</p>

<p>The brand new <strong>Kaleidoscope 4.3</strong> continues to innovate by improving the previously introduced <strong>Git Merge Context Shelf</strong> and <strong>Git File History</strong>. Kaleidoscope now also detects file renames and shows branch names. When used with a service such as GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket, Kaleidoscope now supports jumping to commits, branches, and tickets referenced in commit messages. And it beautifully renders Markdown content in commit messages, which makes browsing and comparing commits so much nicer.</p>

<p>Here are some of the features we added in Kaleidoscope 4:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syntax coloring, with multiple built-in themes.</li>
  <li>Transform any comparison into a merge document that can be edited inline.</li>
  <li>Text filters to clean up diffs by removing irrelevant data, such as time stamps, object addresses and unique identifiers.</li>
  <li>Kaleidoscope Prism, a new helper app in the menu bar to quickly launch comparisons even if Kaleidoscope is not running.</li>
  <li>Debugger integration for Python developers.</li>
  <li>File properties show metadata, including size, file type, dates, and encoding.</li>
  <li>A welcome window that speeds up the processes of creating new comparisons or finding recent ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Subscriptions start at $8 per month for a yearly plan. Use the coupon code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TERPSTRA</code> (valid until December 31, 2023) to get 20% off for the first year. As a student or teacher, the price is reduced even further.</p>

<title>Halp: Universal help for Fish</title>

<p>I’ve had it out there for a while, but I thought I’d point out that I’ve ported my universal “help” command to Fish. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">halp</code> removes the hassle of figuring out whether a command’s help comes from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man CMD</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help CMD</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CMD -h</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type CMD</code>. Just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">halp CMD</code> (where CMD is the command you want help on) and it will figure out the rest.</p>

<p>To install the function, just save the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/fish_files/blob/master/functions/halp.fish">halp.fish</a> file to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.config/fish/functions</code>. Once there, you can just type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">halp CMD</code> to get an appropriate help screen, whether it has a man page, a help page, command line help, or is an alias or function. By default it’s set up to use <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash" title="Dash for macOS-API Documentation Browser, Snippet Manager">Dash</a> for Fish native commands (rather than opening your browser), but you can edit the function to change that (see the comments). That requires that you’ve installed the Fish docset (Dash Preferences-&gt;Downloads-&gt;User Contributed). My local version of the function also replaces the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">man $cmd</code> line with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">open "dash://man%3A$cmd"</code> to open man pages in Dash (requires the manpage docset). Edit as needed to make it work for you.</p>

<p>As an aside, if you regularly edit Fish functions, it can be handy to use your favorite text editor rather than Vim or the internal editor. I have a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funcsubl</code> that wraps the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">funced</code> command with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subl -w</code> and autosaves after closing the window. You can modify this to work with any editor, you just need a “wait” flag (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subl -w</code>). Here’s <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/fish_files/blob/master/functions/funcsubl.fish">my version</a>.</p>

<p>Check out all my public Fish functions in the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/fish_files/tree/master">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

  <p>Hazel can open, archive, tag and even upload. You can have Hazel rename your files or sort them into subfolders based on name, date or whatever combination of attributes you choose. Coupled with Hazel’s powerful pattern matching, you can create workflows to process your files, your way.</p>

<div> Google, API key, searches, SearchLink, DuckDuckGo <br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了Google现在再次提供API key来进行搜索，并且通过SearchLink插件可以将个人API key添加到配置中使用Google进行每天100次的免费搜索。如果没有API key，则继续使用DuckDuckGo。使用Google进行搜索不会涉及任何追踪数据，因此不会带来新的隐私问题。 <div>
<p>So it turns out Google now offers <a href="https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction">an API</a> (once again). It’s limited to 100 searches per day for the free version, so I don’t want to put my API key into the public distribution of SearchLink, but if you want to tap into Google’s power for your searches, you can now add your own API key to the config and get 100 searches per day for free. If you should, for whatever reason, run out of searches in a day, it should gracefully switch out to the previous DuckDuckGo configuration.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!g</code> search will now test for the presence of a Google API key, and if it exists, use Google for the search. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!gg</code> to force a Google search. If there’s not a key set up, it will continue operating as it has using DuckDuckGo. As far as privacy concerns go, these searches don’t include any tracking data, so using Google in this manner shouldn’t present any new issues. For anyone creating plugins, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SL.ddg()</code> method will also test for an API key and use Google if available.</p>

<p>To use this, install the latest version (download below) and then see the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/wiki/Using-Google-Search">wiki page I created</a> to generate your own key.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Tower’s mission is simple: to make Git easy and enjoyable for everyone.</p>

<p>All the features of our native Git client have been carefully crafted with this specific goal in mind. Here are five examples:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Undo any Git operation by simply pressing CMD+Z (or CTRL+Z on Windows). This convenient keystroke allows you to easily roll back any mistakes made.</li>
  <li>Use Drag and Drop to efficiently reorder commits, cherry-pick, merge/rebase branches, or create pull requests.</li>
  <li>Solve merge conflicts easily with Tower’s Merge Wizard, which provides clear context about the conflict.</li>
  <li>Review your repository’s branches with Tower’s “Branches Review” feature. This feature helps identify stale branches or those that have already been fully merged.</li>
  <li>Enable Syntax Coloring to quickly identify changes made in every diff. Tower supports almost 200 languages, making it easy to spot differences in code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of the world’s best software teams use Tower every day - on both macOS and Windows.</p>

  <dd>The idea of a teleprompter is simple, yet so many people screw it up. Teleprompter Premium is my favorite on iOS/Mac, and the same devs have just released a web version of the same. It’s a bit pricier than I think it should be, but you can get a lifetime 50% discount for signing up before Nov 3rd.</dd>

<title>Searchlink, not just for searching</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16420225/searchlink-not-just-for-searching</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16420225/searchlink-not-just-for-searching</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> SearchLink, example code, text filters, plugins, contributing<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了SearchLink以及如何使用它进行网页搜索和文本过滤。作者提供了一些示例代码和插件，并鼓励读者贡献自己的插件。这篇文章是编程爱好者和写作者的好资源。 <div>
<noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="searchlink-text-short-400.jpg" class="alignright" height="142" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/01/searchlink-text-short-400.jpg" title="searchlink-text-short-400.jpg" width="400" />
              </noscript>
            
<p>First, I’ve created a <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink-plugins">repo for SearchLink plugins</a>. This is mostly going to be example code, but you might find some useful ones in there. If you’ve never checked out SearchLink and do any kind of writing that requires linking to web sites/pages, app landing pages, Gist embeds, or basically any kind of blogging, web writing, or show notes, you should <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/">check it out</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink-plugins">plugin repository</a> for details on installing and contributing. All of the available searches in SearchLink are defined as plugins, so you can also <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/tree/main/lib/searchlink/searches">use those as examples</a>.</p>

<h2 id="text-filters">Text Filters</h2>

<p>One thing I wanted to explore was using SearchLink for more than just searches. I created a couple proofs of concept as plugins. Some of these make more sense as TextExpander snippets, but I wanted to experiment, so here’s what I came up with.</p>

<h3 id="mixcase">MixCase</h3>

<p>This plugin is a text filter that will turn <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!mix A string of text</code> into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A STRInG of TExT</code>, randomly capitalizing characters. It’s just to demonstrate how easily a text filter can be implemented (if you know a little Ruby, anyway).</p>

<h3 id="calendar">Calendar</h3>

<p>Another example of a text filter. This one can insert a Markdown calendar for any month and year. You can define the month and year like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!cal 5 2024</code> to get a calendar for May, 2024. If you use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!cal now</code> it will insert a calendar for the current month and year. It can also print how many days are in a month with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!days 2 2024</code> to show how many days are in February in 2024. Silly, and again would probably be better as a TextExpander snippet, but I’m just experimenting with extending SearchLink.</p>

<h3 id="makeadate">MakeADate</h3>

<p>This is a port of a TextExpander snippet I use. It takes a natural language date and inserts a formatted date. It provides the following formats:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Abbr</th>
      <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!ddate tomorrow 8am</code></td>
      <td>2023-11-02 8:00am</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!dshort 2/2/24 6:30am</code></td>
      <td>2024-2-2 6:30am</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!diso tomorrow 1pm</code></td>
      <td>2023-11-02 13:00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!dlong tomorrow 8am</code></td>
      <td>Thursday, November 2nd, 2023 at 8:00am</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>All of the searches can be abbreviated to two letters, with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!diso</code> becoming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!di</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!dlong</code> becoming <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!dl</code>, etc.</p>

<p><strong>This plugin requires that PHP be installed on the system, either with the Apple Command Line Utilties (I think), or with Homebrew (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install php</code>).</strong></p>

<h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>

<p>Use the fully-commented code in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lyrics.rb</code> (<a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/wiki/Plugins">documented in the SearchLink wiki</a>) to generate your own plugins, and reference <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/tree/main/lib/searchlink/searches">the existing searches</a> for inspiration. Feel free to fork and submit a PR to <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink-plugins">the plugin repository</a> if you create something you’d like to share!</p>

<div> SearchLink, v2.3.50, fixes, DuckDuckGo, responses<br />
<br />
总结: 文章介绍了SearchLink v2.3.50发布的修复，以及其中涵盖的DuckDuckGo搜索引擎的回应问题。该版本通过测试，除了一个问题，即在搜索结果中，“Brad Pitt”返回的是电影而不是演员页面。作者还提到了可以在GitHub上找到整理好的源代码，并可以将整个项目编译为一个gem，方便命令行使用。此外，作者鼓励读者对SearchLink进行扩展并提交Pull Request参与开发。 <div>
<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/searchlink/" title="SearchLink">SearchLink</a> 2.3.50 is out and contains fixes for some recent changes in DuckDuckGo’s responses. It currently passes all tests except for one (TMDB is returning a movie for the search result “Brad Pitt”, rather than the actor page, and when I add “actor” to the search it dumps out to IMDB, which I don’t fully understand).</p>

<p>Don’t forget that the source code is all neatly organized on GitHub and you can compile the whole thing as a gem for command line usage, if you like. Every search is <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/searchlink/tree/main/lib/searchlink/searches">a plugin</a> and you can add new search types pretty easily. If you <em>do</em> extend SearchLink at all, be sure to make a Pull Request and be part of the development!</p>

<div> SaneBox, email management, Eisenhower Matrix, organization, efficiency<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了SaneBox和Eisenhower Matrix的组合使用，帮助人们有效管理和组织电子邮件，提高工作效率。通过在SaneBox中创建自定义文件夹，并根据Eisenhower Matrix的四象限原则对邮件进行分类和排序，可以使收件箱变得井然有序。这种方法能够帮助人们更好地处理电子邮件，使邮箱体验更加个性化。如果你正面临着电子邮件堆积如山的困扰，不妨尝试使用SaneBox和Eisenhower Matrix组合的方法。 <div>
<p>Thanks to Sanebox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! I don’t know what I’d do without it!</p>

<p>Envision your email as a bustling conference hall, filled with diverse attendees. Professional correspondences, casual updates, informative newsletters, enticing promotions, and the occasional unwelcome intruder all vying for your attention. Now, consider a seasoned curator (inspired by the Eisenhower Matrix) coordinating the event, teamed up with an expert organizer (the prowess of SaneBox) to streamline the flow and ensure a harmonious gathering. This is the synergy we’re spotlighting.</p>

<p>SaneBox, our sophisticated digital tool, acquires proficiency much like a dedicated student mastering a new subject. Each interaction with your emails refines its algorithm, enhancing its efficiency. When combined with the strategic principles of the Eisenhower Matrix, which prioritizes tasks based on urgency and significance, you’re presented with a seamlessly integrated email management system.</p>

<p>Let’s get practical. The Custom Folders inside of SaneBox let you decide what’s important to you and where it belongs on the Eisenhower Matrix. Start by creating folders for each quadrant. The traditional Eisenhower Matrix works like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Urgent and Important (Quadrant I): These are tasks that need immediate attention and are crucial to your goals.</li>
  <li>Not Urgent but Important (Quadrant II): These are tasks that contribute to your long-term goals and values but don’t require immediate attention.</li>
  <li>Urgent but Not Important (Quadrant III): These tasks demand your immediate attention but aren’t critical to reaching your long-term goals.</li>
  <li>Neither Urgent nor Important (Quadrant IV): These are the tasks that provide little to no value and can often be deferred or even deleted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you’ve created your folders (and named them whatever you want), start moving emails into their appropriate places. It won’t take long for SaneBox to learn what’s important to you. Then you can be selective about which folders get attention and when.</p>

<p>But it’s more than just cleaning up. This method helps shape an email experience that feels uniquely yours. Merging the practical approach of the Eisenhower Matrix with SaneBox’s functions, your inbox goes from being chaotic to organized and manageable.</p>

<p>If you’re among those buried under a mountain of emails, feeling the strain, it’s worth trying the combination of SaneBox and the Eisenhower Matrix. And remember, <a href="https://try.sanebox.com/be2h3q" rel="nofollow">signing up today can even get you a $25 discount on any subscription.</a> Your emails deserve a system that works.</p>

<div> nerdy, forum, projects, interaction, community

总结:<br /><br />这篇文章介绍了一个讨论各种兴趣话题的论坛。作者希望通过这个论坛与读者进行更多互动。文章提到了作者为每个项目建立了不同的讨论论坛，但希望能够整合起来并增加与社区的互动。论坛的链接以及使用的工具也被列举出来。作者希望读者能够积极参与，建立一个活跃的社区。 <div>
<noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />

              </noscript>
            

<p>I’ve created a forum for discussing all things nerdy, the <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com">BrettTerpstra.com Forum</a>. I wanted a place to have conversations about my various projects, but also to allow more interaction with my readers. I’ll be active on it, and I hope you will too.</p>

<p>Right now every one of my projects has different discussion forums, mostly hosted on GitHub, but they’re separated by project and there’s no unified place for support, questions, feature requests, and actual interaction. This is my attempt to consolidate and also increase interaction with the community.</p>

<p>I’m nervous about launching this because I fear nobody will talk and I’ll feel unpopular, but I won’t know until I try. I know, one more place to be active online, one more source of notifications, yet another place to chat. I know we all have too many of these. I chose this format over a Discord server or other synchronous communication because I like that it’s _a_synchronous. You can show up when you feel like it, and just get email notifications about responses to your conversations, waiting until you have the time to add to the discussion.</p>

<p>The forum is at forum.brettterpstra.com. Here’s a <a href="https://forum.brettterpstra.com/invites/o9MfRxFeMG">special invite link</a> that will get you in and give you immediate access to introduce yourself and join/start a conversation.</p>

<p>I set this up using the <a href="https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/marketplace/catalog/discourse/">Discord droplet</a> on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>, which is a very affordable way to host cloud applications, if you’re ever interested in building your own. I’m also using a free account at <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/">Mailgun</a> to handle notification emails and such.</p>

<p>I’ve switched the comments on this blog over to using the forum as an embed. Each blog post will create a new topic on the forum, and you’ll be able to discuss and add comments via Discourse. It will require login (you can log in with GitHub or email), but should offer a saner way to handle comments on my posts. Give it a shot on this one and let me know what you think! In the process I’ve lost all comment history, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope you’ll join, participate, and make a community out of my readership. Don’t be shy. I have 20,000 site viewers, 35,000 RSS subscribers, 13,000 Twitter followers, 2500 Mastodon followers, 9000 GitHub stars, and yet I still have a hard time getting interaction… I’d love to hear from you!</p>

<div> grabicon.rb, iTunes, app icon, automate, ImageMagick<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了一个名为grabicon.rb的工具，它可以从iTunes中获取应用程序的图标，将其用于写作评估或其他需要应用图标的用途。作者经过重新开发和更新，解决了之前工具在获取图标方面的问题，并且增加了许多功能，如定义平台和大小、检索本地图标和搜索iTunes等。通过该工具，用户可以方便地获取到不同平台和尺寸的应用程序图标。 <div>
<p>A long time ago I published a tool called <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/itunesicon/">iTunesIcon</a> that would grab an app icon from iTunes. It worked well in its time, but has been mostly broken in recent years. It was designed mostly for writers who were reviewing apps and needed to get an app’s icon for artwork, but could be used by anyone with a need for such things.</p>

<p>As part of automating the giveaways I’m running, I’ve had a need to start grabbing app icons again, so I’ve revived the project. This script requires installing ImageMagick for rounding the corners of iOS icons (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install imagemagick</code>).</p>

<p>I previously had a shell function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">geticonpng</code> that read a local app’s icon file. These days, most local Mac apps tend to store their icons in Assets.car archives, so the default .icns file only has images up to 256 pixels in most cases. I’ve worked around that. And when a local icon can’t be found, I’m falling back to searching iTunes, replicating the behavior of iTunesIcon. This script handles the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allow defining platform (mac, iOS, iPad, iPhone)</li>
  <li>Allow defining size (small, medium, large, or specific pixel dimensions)</li>
  <li>If the platform is Mac, test for a local copy from which to extract the icon</li>
  <li>If the platform is iOS or a local Mac app isn’t found, search iTunes and return the first result</li>
  <li>If the platform is Mac and a local version is found, extract the icon from the Assets file to allow higher resolutions</li>
  <li>If the platform is iOS, automatically round the corners and resize the image</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/1f30e9042a4cfbdc68bc3fb3fec64046">Here’s the (Ruby) script</a>. It handles all of the above.</p>

<p>Platform can be defined in two ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-d DEVICE</code> flag when running the script. This can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ios</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iphone</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ipad</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mac</code></li>
  <li>Add a modifier to the search terms in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@ios</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@iphone</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@ipad</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@mac</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OmniFocus @ipad</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Similarly, size can be defined using:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s SIZE</code> flag, which can be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s(mall)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">m(edium)</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">l(arge)</code> or a specific pixel dimension (square), e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grabicon.rb -s small OmniFocus</code></li>
  <li>Use a modifier in the search terms in the form of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%s(mall)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%m(edium)</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%l(arge)</code> or a specific pixel dimension, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OmniFocus %1024</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Modifiers in the search terms override flags given to the script.</p>

<p>If a local copy can be found, the asset will be extracted at any size specified. If searching iTunes, you’re generally limited to 1024px, depending on the assets the app has provided. The nearest icon format will be downloaded, and ImageMagick will convert to specific pixel dimensions. Note that when downloading an iOS icon, the artwork provided is square, so the script will round the corners and add 10% padding around the icon (using ImageMagick) to offer similar dimensions to what Mac icons have or what you see on your iOS device screen.</p>

<p>All options:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>Usage: grabicon.rb 'APP NAME/SEARCH TERM' [@PLATFORM] [%SIZE]
       @ and % modifiers override options

OPTIONS:
    -p, --preview                    Show a Quick Look preview after saving
    -s, --size SIZE                  Size to save (small, medium, large, or pixels)
    -d, --device PLATFORM            Platform to search (mac, ios, iphone, ipad)
    -o, --output PATH                Path to save icon to (default ~/Desktop/ICON.png)
    -h, --help                       Display this screen</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is working well for me so far. I’ll publish the rest of the giveaway automation in the future, as it uses some ImageMagick commands I think might be useful to other people. But for now, this is <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/1f30e9042a4cfbdc68bc3fb3fec64046">the new iTunesIcon script</a>.</p>

<p>To install the script, save the raw version to a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grabicon.rb</code> in your PATH, and then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x PATH/TO/grabicon.rb</code>. Once that’s done, just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grabicon.rb -h</code> to see available options.</p>

<p>You may have noticed I’m running a series of giveaways on this blog. Literally every developer I’ve reached out to has been willing to put up 1-10 licenses or 1-year subscriptions for their app, and I’m <em>extremely</em> pleased with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/giveaways/upcoming/">the list I’ve put together</a>. In an effort to keep track of all of them, I’ve built some (if I do say so myself) impressive automation around this project, and I thought I’d share. It’s some mad science, but it’s working great and I kinda want to brag about it.</p>

<p>For every giveaway, there are 5 major pieces:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The announcement post containing the form to enter for the drawing, on Monday</li>
  <li>An announcement email to subscribers linking to the announcement post, also on Monday</li>
  <li>A followup email on Thursday reminding subscribers there’s still time to enter</li>
  <li>A drawing of the winners, and notification emails sent to them, on Friday</li>
  <li>An announcement post listing the winner’s names and upcoming giveaways, also on Friday</li>
</ol>

<p>So here’s how it works. I have a master YAML file where each giveaway has the following info:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">app_name</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Timing</span>
  <span class="na">contact</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">Hookmark link to email conversation with developer</span><span class="pi">]</span>
  <span class="na">dev_email</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Daniel Gräfe &lt;REDACTED&gt;</span>
  <span class="na">keywords</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">productivity</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">time tracking</span><span class="pi">,</span> <span class="nv">timing</span><span class="pi">]</span>
  <span class="na">dev_link</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">https://timingapp.com/</span>
  <span class="na">offer</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">a 1-year subscription ($108 value)</span>
  <span class="na">number_of_prizes</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">1</span>
  <span class="na">followup</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">I guarantee it will be useful for anyone who needs to know where they spend there time, for any reason.</span>
  <span class="na">fulfillment</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">emails</span>
  <span class="na">giveaway_slug</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">[</span><span class="nv">secret giveaway slug</span><span class="pi">]</span>
  <span class="na">blurb</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">&gt;</span>
    <span class="s">I use Timing daily and it's helped me automatically track time that I would never have had the discipline to</span>
    <span class="s">manage on my own. Billable hours, time I spend on personal projects, time I spend gaming, pretty much</span>
    <span class="s">anything I do on my Mac, my iPhone, or my iPad gets tracked and I can easily categorize based on rules</span>
    <span class="s">(that are as easy as dragging and dropping to generate). I even integrated it with</span>
    <span class="s">[Doing](https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/) for adding depth to my "What Was I Doing" tracking.</span>
  <span class="na">dev_blurb</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="pi">&gt;</span>
    <span class="s">Just keep focusing on your work while Timing records your time automatically, then review your time when you</span>
    <span class="s">want to. Record time faster than ever with just a few clicks. See when you worked on what and how</span>
    <span class="s">productive you were.</span>
  <span class="na">screenshot</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">/uploads/2023/09/timingscreenshot.jpg</span>
  <span class="na">setapp</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>It takes me about 10 minutes to build an entry. I have to write out my personal blurb, get a developer blurb from the website, and generate images including a screenshot (usually pulled from the website and automatically sized and converted by a <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/">Hazel</a> script when I save it to my desktop) and a blog header and winner post header<sup id="fnref:imageautomation"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:imageautomation" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. (Social sharing images and WEBP versions are automatically generated from the header images using <a href="https://flyingmeat.com/retrobatch/" title="Retrobatch, from Flying Meat">RetroBatch</a>.) So that’s the bulk of the creation time.</p>

<p>Slotting a new giveaway in is simply a matter of adding a new entry like above to the YAML array, and I can slot them in at any point and all of the dates will adjust accordingly.</p>

<p>When my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giveaways.rb</code> script runs, it goes through this YAML file and generates all of the pieces mentioned above. It has a start date hardcoded for the start of this series, and then for each giveaway entry it adds 7 days, and sets a drawing date for the following Friday. It uses ERB templates to generate the giveaway announcement (including blurbs and screenshot), the two emails, and the winner announcement (including the followup text). The winner announcement, which gets saved to my drafts folder, includes a note letting me know exactly what command to run to execute the drawing, including how many winners to draw, where to pull the fulfillment codes from, etc. The winner announcement is also “hooked” to the conversation with the developer using <a href="https://hookproductivity.com/">Hookmark</a>, so I can easily jump back to it. It also creates a list of upcoming giveaways, saved twice, once to a Markdown file with the secret slugs used to populate and query the Firebase database for the drawing, and once to a list that becomes <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/giveaways/upcoming/">publicly viewable</a>.</p>

<p>The fulfillment key can be one of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">emails</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coupons</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">codes</code>, and depends on the developer’s preference for fulfilling the giveaway. If there are coupons or codes, those get a YAML array listing them and they’re written out to an individual YAML file that the Giveaway Robot will read. The Giveaway Robot (the script that does the random picking of entrants) reads the appropriate type of fulfillment file and sends a notification email to each of the winners containing a link, a redeem code, or notification that their email has been shared with the developer (who gets cc’d based on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev_email</code> setting) who will be in touch with a license.</p>

<p>The emails that are generated are in Markdown format, saved locally. On the week that a giveaway is going to run, I run a script called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_giveaway_emails.rb APP_NAME</code>, where app name is just something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">App Tamer</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Timing</code>. That will find and render the generated Markdown files, apply my BrettTerpstra.com styling, and use the <a href="https://sendy.co/" title="Sendy-Send Newsletters 100x cheaper via Amazon SES">Sendy</a> API to create and schedule both emails for the week.</p>

<p>All of these moving pieces of this are a lot to track, so the script includes notes at every pertinent point letting me know which script needs to be run, and also generates a calendar entry with an alert that links (Hookmark) to the necessary notes, which literally tell me exactly which command to run and what to do with the output.</p>

<p>There’s a Jekyll plugin that generates and runs the giveaway form. I just include:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>{% giveaway SLUG ISO_END_DATE %}</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which is generated automatically by the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">giveaways.rb</code> script in the announcement post, and all entries will go to a Firebase database named for the SLUG. At the end of the giveaway, I just give the same slug to the “robot” and it uses random number generation to pick winners. The robot (run by the command in the winner announcement post note) generates emails to the winners, saves a list of names and emails, and outputs a list of winner names to the Terminal, ready for pasting into the winner announcement post. Actually it also uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pbcopy</code> to put the list right into my clipboard and opens the winner post for pasting…</p>

<p>So, aside from the time it took to build all of this automation, my effort per giveaway is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>email discussion with the developer, nailing down number of copies and fulfillment options, 10m elapsed time per giveaway</li>
  <li>edit the master YAML file with details, 10m</li>
  <li>run the giveaways.rb script, 5s</li>
  <li>on Sunday
    <ul>
      <li>edit and publish the generated giveaway post for the week, 2m</li>
      <li>run the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create_giveaway_emails.rb</code> script to generate the emails, 5s</li>
      <li>double check the emails and scheduling because I don’t fully trust the automation, 2m</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>on Wednesday
    <ul>
      <li>share the giveaway reminder to social media, 5m</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>on Friday
    <ul>
      <li>run the giveaway robot using the command already saved in the winners post, 1m</li>
      <li>edit the giveaway post with the list of winners returned by the robot, 2m</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So, now that the automation is built, it takes me approximately 23 minutes to add and run a giveaway. This would take me at least 3 hours per week if I were doing this manually every time, with the multiple posts, the multiple emails, and the drawing/notification, plus all of the tracking down of previous conversations and handling of codes for every giveaway. So this automation is <em>easily</em> saving me almost 3 hours per giveaway, and with nearly 40 giveaways currently lined up (and growing), that’s almost 120 hours of time saved already. Easily worth the ~8 hours I put into building it.</p>

<p>I doubt all of the scripts behind this will be of use to anyone else as is, but if you want to create any kind of similar automation, I’m available to help. If you just want to see my code to alter on your own, I’ll share it for free, and if you want to hire me to build something out for you, I charge a reasonable hourly fee. If I ever lose my cushy corporate job, this is exactly the kind of thing I would love to freelance on, so keep me in mind for that fateful day.</p>

      <p>All of these header images are the same background with an app icon rotated and positioned in the hand of the “giveaway robot,” but I haven’t yet been able to automate the generation of these images. I just need to extract a PNG from the app (easy), then size, rotate, and position it over a static background. RetroBatch can’t do it, so if anyone has any grand ideas, I’d love to hear them. I bet ImageMagick could do this, but I get into rabbit holes when I start looking into it… <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:imageautomation">&#8617;</a></p>

<div> Bear compatibility, Marked, style, preprocessor, syntax

<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了最新版的Marked在Sonoma上修复了与Bear的兼容性，并提供了Bear的样式和自定义preprocessor来处理Bear的语法。如果想要Marked的预览和Bear一样的样式，可以使用Bear样式和preprocessor；如果只是想要正确解析Bear的语法，可以只使用preprocessor。文章还提供了设置preprocessor的详细步骤，并给出了处理特定语法的preprocessor示例。同时提供了一些帮助和样式设置建议。文章最后提到作者未来可能会直接支持Bear的语法，并提倡根据需要分情况决定是否进行内部链接。 <div>

<p>Recent releases of Marked have fixed Bear compatibility on Sonoma. As part of this, I’ve updated the Bear style for Marked, and written a little custom preprocessor to handle Bear’s (CommonMark) syntax properly. If you want a Marked preview styled to look exactly like Bear (with all of Marked’s options for export, navigation, and other features), you can use the Bear style in combination with the preprocessor, but if you just want Bear’s syntax properly interpreted, you can use the preprocessor with the style of your choosing<sup id="fnref:underline"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:underline" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>To get the Bear style, go the the <a href="https://marked2app.com/styles/">Style Gallery</a> and open the <a href="https://marked2app.com/styles/preview#Bear">Bear style</a>. Click “Install” to add it to Marked in one click.</p>

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>For the custom preprocessor to work, you’ll need Ruby available on your system. As far as I know, Ruby is still distributed with macOS (for now), and if you open Terminal and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">which ruby</code>, you should get a path back, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/bin/ruby</code>. If this isn’t the case for you and you need further help, please post on <a href="http://support.markedapp.com">the support forum</a> and I’ll update the instructions as needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For handling Bear’s specific syntax, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[links]]</code>, underlining, and strikethrough, you’ll need a custom preprocessor. Save the following to a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bear-preprocessor.rb</code> in a safe folder (one you won’t move in the future).</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="c1">#!/usr/bin/env ruby</span>
<span class="c1"># frozen_string_literal: true</span>

<span class="n">input</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gsub!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/==(.*?)==/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'&lt;mark&gt;\1&lt;/mark&gt;'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">input</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gsub!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/~~(.*?)~~/</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'&lt;del&gt;\1&lt;/del&gt;'</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="n">input</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Open terminal and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x /path/to/file/bear-preprocessor.rb</code>. That will make it executable, then you can just add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/path/to/file/bear-preprocessor.rb</code> as your custom preprocessor path in Marked-&gt;Advanced preferences. (To get the absolute path for a file, right click it in Finder, hold down Option, and click ‘Copy “bear-preprocess.rb” as Pathname’. That will put the absolute path to the file in your clipboard, which you can paste for both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod</code> command and the Custom Preprocessor field.)</p>

<p>This script will convert <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[wiki links]]</code> into Bear internal links, which will open linked notes in Bear when clicked, and handle special cases like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~strikethrough~~</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~underline~</code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">, and </code>==highlighting==`.</p>

<p>In addition, you’ll want to set your Processor to MultiMarkdown and enable “#Text is tag” and the sub-item “Style tags” in Preferences-&gt;Processor. Note that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#tag</code> processing will only work if you’re not using a custom <em>processor</em> (custom <em>pre</em>processor like above won’t override it).</p>

                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />

              </noscript>
            

<p>If you need additional help setting this up, just ping me on <a href="http://support.markedapp.com">http://support.markedapp.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re using a non-Bear Style and want underlines formatted, you can modify a custom Style or add the following to Marked-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Style-&gt;Additional CSS and modify as desired:</p>

<div class="language-css highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="nc">.underline</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="nl">border-bottom</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="m">1px</span> <span class="nb">solid</span> <span class="nb">rgb</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="m">222</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">84</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">86</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="err">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>I might eventually add support for Bear (CommonMark) syntax directly to Marked, but the whole purpose of the preprocessor functionality was to handle cases like this, and linking to Bear documents internally should be a case-by-case decision. The same part of the custom preprocessor that handles <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[links]]</code> could be repurposed for any system that allows internal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[[linking]]</code> and has a url handler syntax (like nvUltra, which I’ll post a preprocessor for when it’s available<sup id="fnref:right"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:right" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, or Obsidian). You can also always set up CommonMark as a custom processor to get full compatibility.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:underline">
      <p>It won’t include underline styling unless you add it to your Style, as detailed below <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:underline">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:right">
      <p>you don’t believe me at this point, which is fully understandable, but it really is coming. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:right">&#8617;</a></p>

<title>Marked and Bunch updates for Sonoma</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16381661/marked-and-bunch-updates-for-sonoma</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16381661/marked-and-bunch-updates-for-sonoma</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Marked, Bunch Beta, fixes, Sonoma, updates
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章简要介绍了Marked和Bunch Beta的更新情况，这些更新主要解决了Sonoma上的问题，并修复了一些功能失效的情况。文章提到，Marked更新已经在直接购买渠道上线，并在Setapp和Mac App Store上进行审核中，而Bunch Beta版本的更新则主要修复了Sonoma上的问题，并且需要用户的反馈确认功能是否正常。 <div>
<p>Just a quick note to let you know that there are new versions of Marked and Bunch Beta with some fixes for Sonoma.</p>

<p>The Marked update is live for direct customers, and in review for Setapp and Mac App Store customers. Watch for updates on your channel. It fixes an issue that prevented Marked from opening <em>any</em> files on Sonoma, and also crashes when using with Drafts’ or Bear’s “Preview in Marked” features. It should solve the issue for all versions of macOS.</p>

<p>The Bunch update is specifically to fix modifier keys not working when clicking Bunches in the menu. E.g. you’re supposed to be able to Cmd-Click a Bunch and open the text file in your editor of choice instead of launching it, and this wasn’t working anymore. The current release of the Beta should solve it. I would love some feedback on whether it’s working for you on Sonoma, and additionally whether I broke it for people on earlier versions of macOS. If the fix is solid, I’ll release it to the main channel. You can download the beta <a href="https://bunchapp.co/download/">on the Downloads page</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for any feedback!</p>

<div> giveaway, 1-year subscription, Timing, time tracking, productivity
<br /><br />总结:
这篇文章介绍了一项抽奖活动，奖品是一年期的订阅费用为108美元的Timing软件。该软件可以自动追踪时间，帮助用户记录工作时间、个人项目时间、游戏时间等，并且可以根据规则进行分类。文章还介绍了Timing的功能和优势，鼓励读者参与抽奖活动。 <div>

<p>I’m excited to offer the next giveaway, a 1-year subscription ($108 value) for <a href="https://timingapp.com/">Timing</a>. I use Timing daily and it’s helped me automatically track time that I would never have had the discipline to manage on my own. Billable hours, time I spend on personal projects, time I spend gaming, pretty much anything I do on my Mac, my iPhone, or my iPad gets tracked and I can easily categorize based on rules (that are as easy as dragging and dropping to generate). I even integrated it with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/">Doing</a> for adding depth to my “What Was I Doing” tracking.</p>

<p>From the developer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just keep focusing on your work while Timing records your time automatically, then review your time when you want to. Record time faster than ever with just a few clicks. See when you worked on what and how productive you were.</p>
</blockquote>

<title>Historical weather for Journal CLI</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16373194/historical-weather-for-journal-cli</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 更新、命令行日志工具、历史天气数据、月相、数据收集、心情信息、翻译等<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了命令行日志工具的更新内容，包括可以添加过去日期的自然语言参数，获取历史天气数据，以及跟踪月相等功能。作者对工具的使用感到满意，并愿意帮助他人提供更多帮助。 <div>
<noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />

<p>I pushed a couple updates to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a>, my command line journaling tool today.</p>

<p>As a reminder, you can add a natural language argument to your journal command which will set the date of the entry, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">journal mood "yesterday 8pm"</code>. This allows you to create entries in post with historical data you might have missed. One thing that it didn’t do well, though, is to get the <em>correct</em> weather for any weather type questions in the journal when using past dates. This latest update is able to get historical weather data and insert it correctly in the entry. No changes required for the user, just enter a past date and Journal will figure it out.</p>

<p>Second, I’ve noticed my mood and sleep shifts with the moon phase. I’m not into astrology or anything, but that seemed like useful data to track and start to draw better conclusions from. So now a question type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.forecast</code> will include the moon phase as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">moon_phase</code> key, and you can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.moon</code> to get just the moon phase for its own entry. The forecast in Markdown will also now include the moon phase.</p>

<p>That’s it, just tying up some loose ends. Journal is working pretty well for me to collect data and provide my therapist with detailed mood/behavior information. Let me know if there’s anything it doesn’t do that might help you out!</p>

<p>The latest version can be installed with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code>. Visit the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a> project page for more info.</p>

<div> SaneBox, email clutter, custom folders, personalized email experience, adaptive technology<br /><br />总结: SaneBox是一个强大的电子邮件管理工具，通过其自定义文件夹功能，用户可以根据自己的喜好和优先级来将邮件分类整理，从而创造一个个性化的电子邮件体验。这个功能的灵活性使用户能够根据工作习惯和优先级自由自在地组织邮件，提高工作效率。SaneBox的自适应技术将用户置于核心位置，为用户提供更高效、个性化的邮件管理服务。如果您还在为杂乱的收件箱而烦恼，不妨尝试一下SaneBox的自定义文件夹功能吧。 <div>
<p>Thanks to Sanebox for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! I just trained 3 new senders into custom Sanebox folders today (just by moving an email from them once) and will never have to see them in my Inbox again, and will be able to easily locate them when I <em>do</em> want to see them. It’s so easy!</p>

<p>SaneBox is once again under the spotlight for their cutting-edge solutions to the age-old problem of email clutter. Having earned the endorsement of seasoned professionals, it’s worth diving deeper into another feature that makes SaneBox the power tool for email management. One feature that is particularly enchanting? Custom Folders.</p>

<p>Imagine this: You receive countless emails daily from various sources. Newsletters from your favorite brands, updates from work, personal emails, bulk offers, and then, those pesky spam mails. Now, think of an assistant who not only sorts your emails but also does it exactly how you would. That means keeping in mind your unique preferences and priorities. That’s what SaneBox’s Custom Folder feature offers.</p>

<p>At the core of SaneBox is its learning ability. For example, as you shuffle emails in and out of folders like @SaneLater or @SaneBlackHole, SaneBox observes. Over time, it finds patterns in your preferences and ensures similar emails find their rightful place automatically in the future. It’s like training your dog to fetch. Once it learns which toy is its favorite, it fetches it every single time.</p>

<p>One particularly intriguing aspect of this feature is the flexibility it offers. Let’s say you’re working on a project, and you want all communications about it to be in one place. Simply create a Custom Folder named “@ProjectX.” As you get emails related to the project, drag a few to the new folder, and then SaneBox will quickly learn to play fetch.</p>

<p>The beauty of SaneBox’s Custom Folder feature lies in its adaptability. It’s not just about categorizing. It’s about creating an email ecosystem that aligns with your work habits and priorities. The more seamless a process is, the more likely you’ll be to use it. So that adaptability is critical.</p>

<p>In essence, SaneBox’s Custom Folder feature is more than just about organization. It’s about crafting a personalized email experience. It’s a testament to how adaptive technology can be when it’s designed with the user at its core.</p>

<p>If you’re still juggling with emails and feeling the stress of a cluttered inbox, perhaps it’s time to give SaneBox’s Custom Folder feature a try. And remember, <a href="https://try.sanebox.com/be2h3q" rel="nofollow">signing up today can even get you a $25 discount on any subscription</a>. Make your email work for you, not the other way around!</p>

<div> journal-cli, 更新, 特性, 条件, bug fixes.<br /><br />总结: 这篇文章介绍了 journal-cli 的更新内容，包括新特性和 bug 修复。用户现在可以根据指定的条件来确定是否提问，并且可以添加不同类型的天气数据。还提到了一些 bug 修复和一些使用上的注意事项。 <div>
<noscript class="loading-lazy">

              </noscript>
            

<p>In case you missed it, I recently released <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal CLI">Journal</a>, a CLI for keeping a journal with structured data that can be queried and analyzed. An update is live with a couple of nifty new features.</p>

<p>First, instead of just a type of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather</code> for a question (which inserts the current condition and daily forecast), you can now specify sub-types of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.current</code> and/or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather.forecast</code>. This outputs separate data entries to the JSON, and creates individual answers in the Markdown/Day One versions. You can still just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weather</code> as the type to insert all data.</p>

<p>Second, you can now apply conditions to questions to determine whether they’ll be asked or not when creating an entry. Right now only time-based conditions are implemented, but I plan to add some functionality around basing a question’s appearance on the answer to a previous question, like “if health rating is less than 5, display the health notes question.” But for now you can add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">condition: before noon</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">condition: &gt; 2pm</code> to any question or section to only display the question(s) at certain times of day.</p>

<p>I needed these conditions because I like to create a mood entry in the morning with data about sleep and coffee, and in the evening I don’t want to repeat that data, but do want to ask some different questions about how the day went. I could create two separate journals for these, but this way I can compile all of my data in one file. Questions that are skipped get a null entry in the JSON, so when I’m parsing I just test for nil and skip entries that don’t contain the information I’m trying to output. Unanswered questions don’t get added to the Markdown/Day One entries at all.</p>

<p>This release includes a couple of bug fixes as well. I recently removed the requirement for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gum</code> CLI, if it doesn’t exist it will now just use Readline for input. When using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gum</code> inputs, you can’t CTRL-c to cancel an entry, which I’m trying to figure out a way around right now.</p>

<p>Update using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code>. Visit the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal CLI">project page</a> for more info and installation instructions.</p>

<div> Jekyll plugin, countdown, 40% off sale, coupon, September 16th,
<br /><br />
总结: 这篇文章介绍了一个Jekyll插件，可以用来实现倒计时功能。作者通过插件创建了一个倒计时，用于促销活动。文章中提到了一个40%折扣销售，截止日期是9月16日，使用特定的优惠码可以享受折扣优惠。 <div>
<p>So, a long time ago I wrote this Jekyll plugin that does countdowns and I don’t think I ever really used it. You just give it an end date and it inserts a countdown into the post. But I needed something to count down to, so I’m running a 40% off <a href="https://marked2app.com">Marked</a> sale using the coupon <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COOLPLUGINBRO</code> until Saturday, September 16th. Here’s your countdown:</p>

<div class="btcountdownwrapper">
            <p class="btcountdowncaption">Sale ends in...</p>
            <div class="btcountdown"><time datetime="2023-09-16T23:59:00-05:00"></time></div>
            </div>

<p>Did it work? I hope so. Use <a href="http://pay.paddle.com/checkout/489454?coupon=COOLPLUGINBRO">this link to apply the coupon directly</a>, or enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">COOLPLUGINBRO</code> at checkout. Learn more about Marked at <a href="https://marked2app.com">marked2app.com</a>.</p>

<title>Journal and integrations</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16342944/journal-and-integrations</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16342944/journal-and-integrations</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 日期类型、字典类型、集成应用、JSON格式、功能扩展 <br /><br />总结: 本文介绍了对Journal软件的功能改进，包括日期类型和字典类型的定义，以及与Obsidian等应用的集成。通过引入YAML数据，可以更好地控制结构化数据，便于构建分析工具。此外，文章还提到了版本更新和软件安装方法。 <div>
<p>I’ve made some changes to <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a> (I didn’t mess with the data format this time) that add some functionality and will maybe help with integrating with some apps like Obisidian.</p>

<p>First, you can now define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">date</code> type. Date entries will be parsed from natural language into date objects, so on the command line you can enter something like “yesterday 5pm” or “july 20 12pm” and get a proper date object added to your JSON and Markdown entries. Great for things like logging book review dates, workout days, etc.</p>

<p>You can also now define a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dictionary</code> type for a question, which along with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">key</code> definition creates a nested data set with any dot notation keys that match. So you can define the following:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="na">mood</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="na">sections</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">Status"</span>
    <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">status</span>
    <span class="na">questions</span><span class="pi">:</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">health</span>
        <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">dictionary</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">health.rating</span>
        <span class="na">type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">numeric</span>
        <span class="na">prompt</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">Health Rating</span>
        <span class="na">min</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">1</span>
        <span class="na">max</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="m">10</span>
      <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="na">key</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">health.notes</span>
  <span class="na">    type</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">multiline</span>
        <span class="s">prompt</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="s">Health Notes</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The data that gets output will include this format in the JSON:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="nl">"mood"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"status"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"health"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nl">"rating"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
        </span><span class="nl">"notes"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Just some notes on my health"</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This allows for more control over the structured data. It won’t be a big deal for most people as answers were already nested within section keys and could be grouped using dot syntax, this just allows the structure to go one level deeper which may help with building analytics tools.</p>

<p>The big change that will allow more integrations with apps like Obsidian is that all numeric and date answers are now included as YAML front matter in any individual Markdown files created. This will allow integration with existing tools like <a href="https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview">Obsidian Dataview</a>, which allows you to create data views based on YAML data in your Obsidian notes. By pointing Journal to your Vault folder, you can have journal entries added to your vault and queryable with Dataview. I haven’t tested this, I just noted that it should be possible with the addition of the YAML data. For the time being I’m not including any string responses in the YAML, as that seems redundant since they’re also included in the body text and available to search.</p>

<p>This update won’t affect data saved to single Markdown files or added to Day One. If you have any ideas about how this could be made more useful, please let me know! Either via the <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/journal-cli/discussions">Discussions</a> or by <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/contact/">contacting me directly</a>.</p>

<p>Version 1.0.19 is out now, just install or upgrade with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code>. See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">project page</a> for more details.</p>

<title>More na updates</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16340947/more-na-updates</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16340947/more-na-updates</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> Command line tool, na, theming, new commands, changelog, TaskPaper files.
<br /><br />
总结: 这篇文章介绍了命令行工具na的最新版本更新，包括了主题设置、新的命令和修复的问题等内容。na是一个用于读取和修改TaskPaper文件的工具。更新后的na版本增加了主题设置功能，使得用户可以自定义操作的颜色输出。此外，还添加了一些新的命令和改进，以及修复了一些问题。详细的更新内容可以在文章的changelog中查看。 <div>
<p>I’ve put some more time into both <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/" title="Journal">Journal</a> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code>. The latest version of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code> represents quite a few hours of tinkering. See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com">na project page</a> for full details. In case you’ve missed in previously, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code> is my command line tool for reading and modifying TaskPaper files in your projects.</p>

<p>I think the biggest thing I’ve added is theming. You can now control the colorized output of your actions using a file at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.local/share/na/theme.yaml</code>. That file is automatically written by na if it runs and it doesn’t exist, and once it’s there, it should be pretty self explanatory. You can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{y}</code> type placeholders (that would make the following text yellow, a full list of color abbreviations is at the top of the file), and you can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{#RGB}</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{#RRGGBB}</code> codes to get specific colors outside of the usual ANSI coloring.</p>

<p>I’ve added new commands like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tag</code> (see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na help tag</code>), and a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--restore</code> option to several commands for removing the @done tag from actions. There’s also a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--replace</code> flag you can tie into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na update --search SEARCH_STRING --replace REPLACE_STRING</code> to perform (wildcard-compatible) search and replace. Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--regex</code> to do a regex search and replace.</p>

<p>There’s a bunch of other new stuff, so I’ll just post the collected changelog.</p>

<h4 id="new">NEW</h4>

<ul>

<p><strong>Time is your most precious resource.</strong> You <em>need</em> to know how you are spending it.</p>

<p><strong>But time tracking is no fun.</strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://timingapp.com/brett2023" rel="nofollow">Timing</a> fixes that.</strong><br />
It <em>automatically</em> tracks <em>all</em> your time, without you lifting a finger:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Timing records how long you use each app, document, and website — without start/stop timers. <strong>These timmes can also be automatically categorized using rules, so you don’t have to do it manually.</strong></li>
  <li>It <strong>imports your iPhone and iPad usage</strong> from Screen Time, giving you a complete picture of all your device usage. No other time tracking app for Mac does this!</li>
  <li>In addition, Timing will also import <strong>phone calls from your iPhone</strong>, so those don’t get lost.</li>
  <li>The same goes for meetings you attend: Timing will automatically <strong>show events from your calendar</strong>, so you never forget to record time spent in meetings again.</li>
  <li>But even when a meeting isn’t on your calendar, Timing automatically <strong>recognizes when a call ends</strong> and lets you record time for it, so that no meeting goes untracked.</li>
  <li>Similarly, when you return to your Mac after a break, Timing will <strong>ask you what you did</strong> during your time away.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these features are <em>optional</em> and configurable, of course. And its <strong>brand-new vertical timeline</strong> makes it even easier to see what you did at a glance.</p>

<p>Timing is the one time-tracking app that will <em>really</em> give you <strong>a complete picture of where your time goes,</strong> all while <em>taking</em> you <strong>much less time to maintain</strong> than other time trackers.</p>

<title>Important Journal CLI updates</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16338322/important-journal-cli-updates</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16338322/important-journal-cli-updates</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> dot syntax, nested keys, data format, custom folders, tool usefulness<br /><br />总结:<br />这篇文章介绍了一个工具的更新内容，修复了使用点语法嵌套键时出现的问题，并添加了自定义文件夹选项来保存条目。这些改进使得工具更加实用。 <div>
<p>Just a couple quick updates to the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/">Journal CLI</a> I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/09/06/journal-a-cli-for-journaling/">published yesterday</a> that I wanted everyone who was trying it out to know about before they have too much data in it.</p>

<p>First, if keys were nested using dot syntax, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">health.rating</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">health.sleep</code>, it would create a hash like:</p>

<div class="language-json highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> 
  </span><span class="nl">"health"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
    </span><span class="nl">"health"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w">
      </span><span class="nl">"rating"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> 
      </span><span class="nl">"sleep"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">7</span><span class="w"> 
   </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">  
</span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, the “health” key got doubled and nested inside of the section key. This isn’t the way it was supposed to work with the dot syntax. Version 1.0.15 fixes this, if a key is repeated it’s merged with the parent key instead of nesting.</p>

<p>I also added options for defining custom folders to save entries in. At the top level you can include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entries_folder</code> with a path to any folder on your system. Journals will all save to that folder with subdirectories for each of their keys. You can instead define <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entries_folder</code> within a journal definition, allowing each journal to have a custom location. JSON and Markdown will be written to these folders based on settings.</p>

<p>That should help make this tool a bit more useful, sorry for changing the data format, but better sooner than later. Check out the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/journal-cli/">project page</a> for more details.</p>

<title>Journal, a CLI for journaling</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16334303/journal-a-cli-for-journaling</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16334303/journal-a-cli-for-journaling</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> couple's therapy, neurodivergence, command-line tool, data collection, journaling<br /><br />总结:<br />这篇文章介绍了一种命令行工具，用于在夫妻治疗中收集数据并进行日记记录。这个工具可以处理数字、字符串和多行输入，并且可以创建Day One和Markdown版本的条目。它还可以记录每天的天气情况。虽然还没有实现查询数据集的功能，但作者认为通过统计分析可以对数据进行跟踪和相关性分析。通过这个工具，作者能够获得自己的情绪和日志的概览。希望这个工具能对其他人也有帮助。 <div>
<p>I recently started couple’s therapy to try and improve the often-complicated relationship between myself (ADHD, bipolar) and my partner (autistic) and all of the unique problems that combination of neurodivergence presents. As part of this, I was asked to keep a journal containing certain data points. I started off journaling in Day One, but immediately realized that I was collecting some numeric data that I wouldn’t be able to do anything with unless it was stored in a database format of some kind. So I wrote a tool.</p>

<p><a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/journal-cli/">Journal</a> is a command-line tool that takes a configuration of journals, sections, and questions, presents the questions on the command line, and records the answers to JSON, as well as optionally creating Day One and Markdown versions of the entries. It can handle numeric data, string and multiline input, as well as automatically recording the daily weather for each entry.</p>

<p>To use it you need <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum">Gum</a> installed (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">brew install gum</code>). If you want to use the Day One integration, you’ll also need to <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/guides/tips-and-tutorials/command-line-interface-cli/">install the Day One CLI</a>. Those are the only prerequisites. You can just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install journal-cli</code> to get the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">journal</code> command set up. It can handle multiple journal configurations and multiple output formats. It takes some configuration, but it’s very flexible (and will probably get more flexible as new needs arise).</p>

<p>I haven’t written the part of this that can query the datasets created yet. That’s going to be pretty individualized based on your needs, but I think everything should be there in the JSON to allow tracking and correlations with a little statistical analysis work. I’ll dig into it more once I’ve collected enough data. In the meantime, it’s also creating nicely-formatted Day One entries so I can get an overview of my moods and journals.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/journal-cli/">project page</a> for details on setup and configuration. Hopefully others will find this useful, too!</p>

<title>A bit more na work</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16322833/a-bit-more-na-work</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16322833/a-bit-more-na-work</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I went on a trip to Minneapolis this weekend. It went really well; I saw some 
great friends, ate some great food, and spent some early mornings coding at the hotel. I was just coding to kill time when I couldn’t sleep, and playing with <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na</code></a> seemed like the perfect way to do it.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was take a second stab at “decomposing” the main binary so that each command had its own file, just to make maintenance easier. Finally got that working properly. It won’t change anything for the user, but it’s so much nicer <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/na_gem/tree/main/bin/commands">to look at</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive</code> commands I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2023/08/22/some-na-updates-and-new-commands/">added last week</a>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> command now has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--restore</code> flag that can be used to remove the @done tag from an action or actions. It’s the same as using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--remove done</code>, but I find it just a little more intuitive. This flag is mirrored as an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na restore [SEARCH]</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na unfinish [SEARCH]</code>) command.</p>

<p>I also added pagination, so for output that is longer than your screen, it will now pause using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">less</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">more</code> if available, letting you page through with shortcut keys. This also applies to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">help</code> command, so it’s easier to wade through the extensive documentation that the command provides. You can disable this with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na --no-pager [COMMAND]</code>, a setting which can be saved to your config.</p>

<p>I added an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na completed</code> command to view @done actions. It accepts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--before</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--on</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--after</code> flags that recognize natural language dates and can be combined. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--tagged TAG</code> to find actions tagged with any combination of tags (use comma separated list or use the flag multiple times, include a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> to make a tag mandatory, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code> to negate). Any arguments passed to the command will function as a tokenized text search. And, of course, you can run it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--save [NAME]</code> to save a complex search for later use with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved</code> command.</p>

<p>Speaking of saved searches, I also changed the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">saved</code> command to allow multiple saved searches to run at once. So now if you have a saved search for low priority and one for medium priority, you can run them both together with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na saved lowprio medprio</code> and get combined results.</p>

<p>Also:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--done</code> flag not working on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na next</code></li>
  <li>Missing descriptions in help examples</li>
  <li>When replacing a priority tag, remove any space before it the action text</li>
  <li>Detect @tags in search strings and convert them to tag search with comparisons</li>
</ul>

<title>Some na updates and new commands</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16308395/some-na-updates-and-new-commands</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16308395/some-na-updates-and-new-commands</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’ve updated <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/na/" title="na - BrettTerpstra.com">na</a> with some new stuff I thought I’d share.</p>

<p>First off, I wanted an easy way to archive all @done actions in one swoop without having to use a lot of flags and switches to locate them and move them. So I added an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive</code> command, which takes a search string as an argument, but also has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--done</code> switch that will archive all @done tasks. So you can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na archive --done</code>, select the file to affect if there are multiple available, and presto, “archive all finished” is done, just like in TaskPaper.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>NAME
    archive - Mark an action as @done and archive

SYNOPSIS

    na [global options] archive [command options] ACTION

COMMAND OPTIONS
    --all             - Act on all matches immediately (no menu)
    -d, --depth=DEPTH - Search for files X directories deep (default: 1)
    --done            - Archive all done tasks
    -e, --regex       - Interpret search pattern as regular expression
    --file=PATH       - Specify the file to search for the task (default: none)
    -n, --note        - Prompt for additional notes. Input will be appended to any existing note. If STDIN input (piped) is detected, it
                        will be used as a note.
    -o, --overwrite   - Overwrite note instead of appending
    --tagged=TAG      - Match actions containing tag. Allows value comparisons (may be used more than once, default: none)
    -x, --exact       - Match pattern exactly

EXAMPLE

    # Find "An existing task", mark @done if needed, and move to archive
    na archive "An existing task"</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> command that will add a @done tag to whatever action matches your search (menu provided for multiple results), or all matches using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--all</code> switch. It’s basically a shortcut for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">na update --finish SEARCH_STRING</code>. It’s aliased as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">finish</code> as well. Both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> commands have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--note</code> switch that allows you to add a note (prompted if there’s nothing piped to it). All of the matching options from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">update</code> command are available, including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--tagged</code> for searching by tag and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--regex</code> for doing a regular expression search. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">complete</code> has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--archive</code> switch that will simultaneously add a @done tag and move the action to the Archive.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code>NAME
    complete - Find and mark an action as @done

SYNOPSIS

    na [global options] complete [command options] ACTION

COMMAND OPTIONS
    -a, --archive     - Add a @done tag to action and move to Archive
    --all             - Act on all matches immediately (no menu)
    -d, --depth=DEPTH - Search for files X directories deep (default: 1)
    -e, --regex       - Interpret search pattern as regular expression
    --file=PATH       - Specify the file to search for the task (default: none)
    -n, --note        - Prompt for additional notes. Input will be appended to any existing note. If STDIN input (piped) is detected, it
                        will be used as a note.
    -o, --overwrite   - Overwrite note instead of appending
    --tagged=TAG      - Match actions containing tag. Allows value comparisons (may be used more than once, default: none)
    -x, --exact       - Match pattern exactly

EXAMPLES

    # Find "An existing task" and mark @done
    na complete "An existing task"

    # Alias for complete
    na finish "An existing task"</code></pre></div></div>

<title>Convert RegExRX native files to Markdown snippets</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16306720/convert-regexrx-native-files-to-markdown-snippets</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16306720/convert-regexrx-native-files-to-markdown-snippets</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I <em>love</em> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/regexrx/id498370702?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=10l4tL&amp;ct=searchlink">RegExRX</a> for testing regular expressions. It has all the features I could want from such an app, including the ability to copy a working regex out prepared for a range of languages. It’s what I’ve stuck with for years.</p>

<p>As I experiment with my regexes, I’ll save them in RegExRX, creating a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.regexrx</code> file in my Snippets folder (where <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/snibbets/">Snibbets</a> works). In order to make these searchable with Snibbets, I use a script to convert the XML-based <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.regexrx</code> file to a Markdown file with the flags, search string, and the replace string and test text if they exist. I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/regexrx2md/">turned this into a gem</a> for anyone who should happen to run into such a need.</p>

<p>You can install the tool with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install regexrx2md</code>. Once installed, just use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regexrx2md -o MARKDOWN_DIRECTORY SOURCE_DIRECTORY</code> to output a bunch of Markdown files from a directory of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.regexrx</code> files. You can also convert a single file just by providing a file link as the argument instead of a directory.</p>

<p>There are options for manipulating the filename, the Markdown template, and the output directory. See <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/regexrx2md/">the docs</a> for more info. While I hope this is useful to someone, it was something I useful enough to me to invest the time in, so it’s already paid off sufficiently. I just thought I’d share… just in case.</p>

<title>Kaleidoscope 4.1: Now with Git File History (and a special coupon) [Sponsor]</title>

<p>Thanks to Kaleidoscope for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com again this week! The addition of Git History diffing is excellent, and I’m excited to share it with everybody.</p>

<p>Review versions of text and image files — and even folders full of files — with the world’s most powerful file comparison app. Kaleidoscope gives you powerful tools to use at each stage of the development cycle.</p>

<p>Now with version 4.1, Kaleidoscope continues to innovate by directly integrating with Git to show you a history for a single file. This makes it incredibly easy to track changes to a file over time. <a href="https://blog.kaleidoscope.app/2023/08/08/kaleidoscope-4-1-and-git/" rel="nofollow">Check out this blog post</a> for a detailed overview of how you can use this powerful new integration.</p>

<p>As Michael Tsai wrote: “… Kaleidoscope makes some of these tasks really easy. There are many ways to get it to open a single file, and then it automatically loads the history (and even the previous version, if you want). It’s easy to navigate the history to pick which versions you want to compare.  I’ve seen many different apps implement this type of interface, and Kaleidoscope’s version may be the best.”</p>

<p>Dave Verwer: “The UI of clicking through the history of a file with A and B buttons is simple and brilliant.”</p>

<p>In case you missed it, here are some of the most exciting features we added to Kaleidoscope with version 4:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Syntax coloring, with multiple built-in themes.</li>
  <li>Transform any comparison into a merge document that can be edited inline.</li>
  <li>Text filters to clean up diffs by removing irrelevant data, such as time stamps, object addresses and unique identifiers.</li>
  <li>Kaleidoscope Prism, a new helper app in the menu bar to quickly launch comparisons even if Kaleidoscope is not running.</li>
  <li>Debugger integration for Python developers.</li>
  <li>File properties show metadata, including size, file type, dates, and encoding.</li>
  <li>A welcome window that speeds up the processes of creating new comparisons or finding recent ones.</li>
</ul>

<p>Subscriptions start at $8 per month for a yearly plan. Use the coupon code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TERPSTRA</code> (valid until August 31, 2023) to get 20% off for the first year. <a href="https://kaleidoscope.app/" rel="nofollow">Check it out today!</a></p>

<title>Orchard Resales: get yourself a Mac mini, cheap [Sponsor]</title>

<p>Thanks to Orchard Resales for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! If you’re looking for an older Mac mini to use as a server or entertainment center, you can pick up used 2012/2014 models <em>dirt</em> cheap!</p>

<p><a href="https://orchardresales.com/collections/all" rel="nofollow">

            </a></p>

<p>I use a 2012 Mac mini as a basement server, running headless (no keyboard or monitor) and controlled over screen sharing. It runs Docker (and a few containers that give me things like network speed charts and VPN tunneling), Plex, and all of my home automation with all of my controllers hooked up to its USB ports. I also have a Synology, but you can easily set up file storage and serving with a Mac mini and a big external RAID drive. The one I run in my basement is a 2012 with a 500GB SSD and 16GB RAM. I’ve never needed to upgrade it any further to get everything I need out of it.</p>

<p>Want to set up your own, or have another use in mind for an old mini? Well, thanks to Orchard Resales you can pick one up for as little as $50 US. Deck one out with 16GB of RAM and an SSD and you’ll come out around $100. For a whole server, and it’s as easy to set up as using a Mac. And if you need spare parts, you can get non-functional Mac minis starting at just $15.</p>

<title>Personal update: CPTSD edition</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16275514/personal-update-cptsd-edition</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16275514/personal-update-cptsd-edition</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m afraid you’ve been seeing a lot of sponsored posts and not enough posts from me lately, so I thought I’d try to explain why.</p>

<p>After a relationship in my life was destabilized and I had an outsized reaction to it, I started trying to figure out what was going on with me. I was pointed toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder">Complex PTSD</a> and from there I discovered that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_trauma_syndrome">Religious Trauma Syndrome</a>, while not a part of the DSM, was a recognized thing, and that the causes and symptoms fit me perfectly.</p>

<p>I’ve spent the last couple of weeks trying to unpack what this means for me. So much of the me I’ve come to know is explained by this: my attention issues, my memory problems, my emotional dysregulation, my drug addictions, and even my Bipolar Disorder can all be tied to RTS and CPTSD.</p>

<p>I grew up as a “different” kid in a fundamentalist church. As a young child I had urges and thoughts that I constantly feared would send me to hell. When I wasn’t worried about my eternal soul, I was worried about my non-Christian friends and <em>their</em> eternal souls. By the time I was in Middle School I was drinking and trying to cope with what amounts to a <em>constant</em> fight or flight response, in addition to grief.</p>

<p>Being neurodivergent, queer, and highly sensitive was not a good combination for me in the church I grew up in. And I was taught to put all of my value, all credit for my successes, and all forms of attachment into God, not earthly things. So when I decided the church wasn’t good for me (or, in my mind, for anyone), I had the secondary trauma of leaving. Becoming emotionally estranged from my family, losing my Christian friends, and losing a god, the one thing that I had ever believed could save me. I still have a lot to learn about attachment theory, but it’s safe to say that I never felt securely attached to any people in my life, from my earliest memories. Which, to be fair, are very sparse, because a symptom of CPTSD is amnesia, if I understand it correctly. I’ve always wondered why everyone else remembered so many things from their younger years and I only had occasional memories of moments. Not events, not periods, nothing substantial, only snippets. I couldn’t remember who was there, how I felt about them, only whether I felt safe or scared in that moment. And most of what I remember is feeling scared.</p>

<p>I started therapy with a new counselor last week. She actually has a psychology PhD and does trauma-informed therapy, and I think she’ll be much more helpful than my last therapist. I have high hopes. All I know is that if it doesn’t work out I absolutely have to keep working to find a good fit, because this shit is more than I know how to deal with on my own, and I can’t expect the people in my life to deal with it for me. All of my insecurities have been laid bare, I’m reacting to the world from a raw and frightened place non-stop, and it’s exhausting. I need to learn how to find security, validation, and love within myself and not depend on external sources just to exist. And that’s something I never learned how to do as a Christian. It’s been 30 years since I stopped believing, and I’m still not a whole person.</p>

<p>I’m an atheist these days, and it was a hard fought battle against my ingrained thoughts. I declared myself agnostic in my late teens, but it seriously took 20 years for me to stop looking over my shoulder and wondering if I was making a serious mistake that would <em>definitely</em> doom me to eternity in Hell. I’m over that now, I think, but I still watch anti-theist YouTube all the time, and it makes me wonder if part of me is still scared. I don’t have any interest in the god of the Bible — he’s a real asshole. And I was raised to believe that any other version of God was heresy — even other sects of Christians were going to hell. If you didn’t worship the specific version of God that was defined by my church, you were going to burn. So if I can’t accept that religion, then there’s no religion that would calm my nervous system. It was trained into me as a child. I’m constitutionally incapable of having Faith (capital F), and I was taught that without Faith you’re doomed, and now I’m just trying to put it all behind me. I’m flailing a bit.</p>

<p>I had to tell my parents I couldn’t see them for Saturday morning breakfast for a while. They’ve always been kind to me. They (and their friends) have prayed for my eternal soul. They raised me the way they were raised and I don’t blame them for repeating the trauma. But every time I see them I’m re-traumatized and I didn’t realize what was happening until now. I’ve been to the hospital multiple times with heart problems, and guess what? It was almost always within 24 hours of having breakfast with my parents. I’ve decided that’s not a coincidence. They were very understanding, and I really believe they want the best for me, I just can’t disassociate them from my childhood trauma. Hopefully I can let go of that and reestablish a relationship with my parents.</p>

<p>So that’s why I haven’t been writing. I’ve been trying to grapple with 45 years of fear I had successfully avoided until now. I’ll be back. I’m reading, I’m going to therapy, I’m working to understand and develop tools for moving forward. I’m going to be stronger for having all of this laid bare and being forced to deal with it.</p>

<title>BetterTouchTool: Introducing floating menus [Sponsor]</title>

<p>Thanks to BetterTouchTool for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week! I am a <em>huge</em> fan of BetterTouchTool and use it all day every day on my Mac. I wouldn’t know what to do without it. From customizing my keyboard shortcuts to adding infinite gestures to my trackpad to running my entire Stream Deck setup, there’s nothing this little utility can’t do.</p>

            </a></p>

<p>I think BetterTouchTool is well known to readers of this blog (thanks Brett!), so I won’t go into the details of the many things you can do with it. Instead I want to promote a powerful new feature that has been added to BTT recently and is currently in beta phase: Floating Menus.</p>

<p>Imagine them as highly flexible, widget-like menus that you can place virtually anywhere on your screen.  You can attach them to specific positions in specific windows, to specific screens, the current mouse position and many more. You can specify whether they float on top, stick them to your desktop or have them behave like normal windows (and more). </p>

<p>They can always be visible, expand on mouse hover or be shown/hidden via any trigger in BTT.</p>

<p>A Floating Menu contains either standard buttons, or widgets like sliders or even web view items. Their appearance is completely customizable. All items are fully scriptable via AppleScript or Javascript, and soon there will be a plugin system to load custom widgets.</p>

<p>The Floating Menus will soon become the basis for numerous existing BetterTouchTool features, such as Stream Deck and Notch Bar support and several predefined actions. These will gradually transition to utilize the Floating Menu rendering and scripting engine making them more flexible and robust by streamlining maintenance &amp; future development.</p>

<p>Additionally, the upcoming (entirely new) version of the iOS BTT Remote app will be capable of rendering your custom Floating Menus on your iPhone or iPad. </p>

<p>You can find various Floating Menu examples on <a href="https://share.folivora.ai" rel="nofollow">share.folivora.ai</a>. For example have a look at the Notch menu, which is invisible by default but expands from your Macbook’s Notch on hover. Another nice example is the “Mini Emoji Menu” preset: it places a little transparent dot on the left edge of the active window, which, when hovered, shows multiple custom emoji which you can insert by clicking.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://docs.folivora.ai/docs/1600_floating_menus.html" rel="nofollow">documentation for this new feature</a> is already available, and you can always come to <a href="https://community.folivora.ai/c/floatingmenus/18" rel="nofollow">the community site</a> to discuss or request features. Now that I have a solid working base, I can easily built on it, so please report any bugs and request any feature you can think of!</p>

<title>Sanebox, your email concierge [Sponsor]</title>

<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16213929/sanebox-your-email-concierge-sponsor</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As I’ve said before, I’m a long time user and lover of Sanebox. Thanks to them for sponsoring again this week. Here’s a user story from Thomas Yuan.</p>

<p><a href="https://try.sanebox.com/be2h3q" rel="nofollow">
              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="sanebox_banner_june.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="265" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/06/sanebox_banner_june_2.jpg" title="sanebox_banner_june.jpg" width="800" />
              </noscript>
            </a></p>

<p>Well, here’s a funny thing: I started using SaneBox because my email was an utter disaster, and I needed something to save me from the deluge. Little did I know that I was stepping into a world where email isn’t just manageable, it’s… well, sane. I know, I know…</p>

<p>SaneBox is like having your own personal email concierge. It’s not just a filter - oh no, that’s underselling it. It’s like a highly-trained butler who goes through your mail, knows what’s important, and presents you with only the choicest pieces of correspondence.</p>

<p>Everything else? Neatly sorted away, out of sight, out of mind.</p>

<p>Setting up SaneBox is as easy as pie. And I’m not talking about some complicated lattice-top apple pie here. I mean one of those simple, comforting pumpkin pies. You just connect your email account, and voila, SaneBox starts its magic. It learns from your actions, your patterns, tailoring its sorting to your specific needs.</p>

<p>Now, the main feature here is the @SaneLater folder. It’s like a second inbox, except it’s where all the non-urgent emails go to hang out. Newsletter from that one store you bought socks from 3 years ago? That’s a @SaneLater item. Automated system alert about a software update? You bet that’s going in @SaneLater.</p>

<p>What’s more, you can customize it to your heart’s content. There’s @SaneBlackHole for those pesky emails you never want to see again, and @SaneNews for newsletters and the like. You can even create your own folders, and SaneBox will learn to sort your emails accordingly.</p>

<p>And don’t get me started on @SaneReminders. Ever sent an email and needed a reminder if nobody replies? Just CC or BCC to 1week@sanebox.com, and if there’s no reply in a week, it pops back up in your inbox. It’s like a boomerang made out of pure organizational power.</p>

<p>Sure, there are other email management tools out there. But SaneBox stands out for its simplicity, its flexibility, and, most of all, its effectiveness. It’s like it took my unruly, wild-west email inbox and turned it into a sleek, streamlined, email-answering machine. And, in a world where every spare minute counts, who wouldn’t want that?</p>

<p>So, if you’ve got an email inbox that’s more like a black hole, give SaneBox a whirl. I promise you, you won’t be disappointed. It’s affordable, efficient, and pretty darn fun to use.</p>

<p>And here’s a pro tip: if you’re ever unsure about a feature, just explore their help center. It’s packed with useful guides and tips. It’s like the cherry on top of the SaneBox sundae.</p>

<p>My cat died a couple weeks ago. I had him for 20 years and he’s left a large hole in my life. I know not everybody gets cats the way cat people do, but he was honestly one of my closest friends. I just wanted to write a bit about him now that the grief is a bit less raw and just remember him for the legend he was.</p>

<p>My ex and I were around when Yeti’s mom had her litter. She had health problems and sadly had to be euthanized shortly after Yeti and his siblings were weaned. I had my pick of the litter. I had recently lost a tuxedo cat (Trouble) to a pit bull attack, and thought I’d take the one tuxedo in the litter. Aditi’s mom suggested I also take this one bashful kitten who had a hairline similar to mine. I agreed. Jezebel (the Tuxedo) became Aditi’s cat, and Yeti almost immediately became very bonded to me. I’ve always been thankful I was talked into taking him.</p>

<p>Both Yeti and Jezebel were polydactyl, and Yeti’s front paws had six toes each. I almost named him Big Foot, but given his long, thick white hair, “Yeti” seemed more apropos.</p>

<p>Yeti displayed what can only be anthropomorphized as “empathy.” He always understood when I was sad or sick and would lay by me, placing one paw on my thigh, or curl up on the couch behind me and put his paw on my shoulder. And when I was happy or comfortable, he would be in my lap. He loved to sit facing me with his paws on my chest and give me nose bumps. He learned very young that licking my nose repeatedly was a bit painful, and would just give one lick or tap and then stop.</p>

<p>Speaking of understanding pain, Yeti learned at a very young age that his claws and teeth hurt me, and after he got past the part of his life where he would try to climb my leg with his sharp little kitten claws, he never bit or scratched anybody, ever. I once held him while a urinary crystal was removed through his urethra; he held onto my arm and yowled, but never clawed or bit, which was impressive. I think if someone was squeezing a rock through my private bits I would probably try to bite the nearest arm I could.</p>

            </figure>

<p>Jezebel passed away under the care of Aditi a few years back. We honestly never expected Yeti to outlive her, but he lived to 19 years and 9 months and I enjoyed every minute of it. I’ve spent more time with Yeti than with any human in my entire life. He was always around. I never even saw my parents that much from 0-18. And I’ve never had a romantic relationship longer than about 13 years. So Yeti was my longest relationship and the “partner” I’ve spent the most of my life with. I appreciate humans and all, but Yeti and I never had a fight or even a misunderstanding. He was just always there for me. I gave him all my love, and he returned it.</p>

<p>Yeti has been living with my partner Elle and I for about 5 years now. It took him a while, but he eventually accepted Elle as his other person. He worked his way into her heart and Elle loved him as much as I did. He helped pull our little “family” together, and I know she’s missing him right now, too.</p>

<p>The last couple years have been full of health scares. He went from 20 pounds to 6 pounds at the end. He had a bout of pancreatitis, and then kidney failure. We’d been expecting him to die for quite a while now, so we had plenty of time to prepare for this. And he gave me the best ending I could imagine…</p>

<p>He was energetic and loving on Thursday, and then at 2am on Friday he crawled under my covers and fell asleep. That was the last time he moved on his own. He spent the day with me Friday, with his paw in my hand or on my leg. I would place him in the middle of the couch and then work on my laptop on the side, and he would pull himself over to me to put his paw on me or bury his head in my thigh. I took him to bed with me that night. On Saturday at 5:15am, I rolled over and put my hand on him. He took two deep breaths and then exhaled his last. Man, he waited until I woke up to say goodbye. Seriously, he was the most caring cat you’ll ever meet.</p>

<p>I will always miss Yeti, but he gave me a great 20 years in the prime of my life. I’m not nearly as devastated as I thought I’d be. It was all so peaceful. He stayed by me all the way to the end, and I’ll be eternally grateful that he passed peacefully at home and I didn’t have to make the decision to end his life in a cold vet’s office. I’ve done that with beloved pets a dozen times over the years, and it’s a horrible thing to go through. Yeti gave me a fairy tale of an ending.</p>

<p>I made a video out of 20 years’ worth of pictures. It’s too long, but if you want to enjoy it and have the patience for it, consider it my tribute to the best cat ever.</p>

<title>Snibbets 2.0.34</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16195268/snibbets-2-dot-0-34</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16195268/snibbets-2-dot-0-34</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I released a new version of
<a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/">Snibbets</a> this morning that solves one
peculiarity: if you have multiple snippets in one file but any of them
don’t contain code blocks, then the titles and display would get weird.</p>

<p>Now you can have sections of a snippet file (separated by ATX headers)
that contain just notes. If a section contains just notes and no code,
then the notes will be output for that section, even when not using
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--notes</code> or having <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">all_notes: true</code> set in config.</p>

<p>This just allows for uses of Snibbets as both a note reference and a
snippet manager. It probably won’t effect people who are using it “as
intended,” but opens up new use cases.</p>

<p>To get the latest version, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install snibbets</code>. See the <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/">project
page</a> for more details.</p>

<title>Doing with multiple sections</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16160573/doing-with-multiple-sections</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16160573/doing-with-multiple-sections</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Funny story: I got a feature request for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/mdless/" title="mdless">mdless</a> to allow multiple sections to be specified in the output, but I misread the notification as a request for <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/doing/" title="doing - BrettTerpstra.com">Doing</a>. So I spent a couple hours adding multiple section handling to an array of Doing commands and happily reported the result to the user, who was very confused by the version number I gave him. I apologized and have now added multiple section handling to mdless, which was a <em>lot</em> less work than adding it to Doing. So I might as well write a blog post about the Doing feature nobody asked for, I guess.</p>

<p>Most of Doing’s many commands allow for the specification of a particular section, e.g. the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show</code> command can limit its results to just one section, or the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tag</code> command can tag the last X entries from a given section. Now, almost all of these commands can take multiple sections, either specified as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s section1,section2</code> or by using multiple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s</code> flags in the same command, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doing show -s currently -s later</code>.</p>

<p>This allows a little more flexibility, especially for display commands. It also means you can perform actions on a more limited set of entries without limiting it to just a single set. It (obviously) doesn’t apply to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">now</code> command or other entry commands because an entry can only be in one section.</p>

<p>By the way, section names are fuzzy matched, so you can specify that you want results from both Currently and Later (assuming you have such sections) with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s curr,lat</code>.</p>

<p>If I expand this further, I’ll allow negative arguments as well, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">doing show -s -archive</code> to exclude the Archive section. But for now it’s just multiple sections.</p>

<p>That’s all for now, just figured I’d mention it since I put the effort into it. You can update to the latest with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install doing</code> (which might require <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo</code>, depending on your setup).</p>

<p>This post will only be of interest to those using the <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/" title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard-The keyboard. For professionals.">Ultimate Hacking Keyboard</a> (<abbr title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard">UHK</abbr>), specifically with the lefthand <a href="https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/product/keycluster">key cluster module</a>. I recently added some customizations I thought might be worth mentioning to those who happen to have this setup. For those who don’t, maybe read on and be tempted by the possibilities…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The latest version of the <a href="https://github.com/UltimateHackingKeyboard/agent">Agent software</a> for the <abbr title="Ultimate Hacking Keyboard">UHK</abbr> allows the definition of up to four additional Function layers, or sets of keys that are mapped when a modifier is held down. You’re probably used to the Mod layer, which is how you turn I/J/K/L into arrow keys, etc. when you hold the Mod key, and the Fn layer, which turns 1 into F1 when you hold the Fn key. By clicking the down arrow on the layer bar, you can now check boxes next to Fn2-Fn5 layers to enable them. Then you can assign keys to trigger them, which is where the key cluster module comes in.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="enable-layers-800.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="315" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/enable-layers-800.jpg" title="enable-layers-800.jpg" width="800" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>The key cluster module provides 3 extra keys to the right of your B key and Space key (by default it’s the Mod key, but I swap my Mod and Space keys). I initially assigned these to <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-R"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">R</kbd></span> on the top (<span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-B"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">B</kbd></span> when Mod is held, creating Run and Build buttons in Xcode and other IDEs, and a Refresh button in most other apps), and Enter and Backspace on the bottom two keys (Numpad Return and Forward Delete when Mod or Fn is held). But then I realized they could further function as triggers for other layers.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />

              </noscript>
            

<p>You can assign a secondary function to any key, which is an action that’s performed when it’s held while another key is pressed. For example, I change the default Mouse key into Caps Lock (which becomes my <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2015/12/18/a-hyper-key-that-can-still-yell/" title="A Hyper Key that can still YELL">Hyper key</a> along with <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/" title="Karabiner-Elements">Karabiner Elements</a>), and use the secondary function on the Tab key so that when it’s held in combination with other keys, it triggers the Mouse layer.</p>


              <noscript class="loading-lazy">
                <source media="(max-width: 640px)" />
                <source type="image/webp" />
                <source />
                <img alt="tab-mouse.jpg" class="aligncenter" height="426" src="https://cdn3.brettterpstra.com/uploads/2023/05/tab-mouse.jpg" title="tab-mouse.jpg" width="689" />
              </noscript>
            

<p>The bottom left key of the module is a very natural reach for the left thumb, and was the first layer I created. I added a Fn2 layer, and then assigned the secondary function of that key to trigger the Fn2 layer when held. Now I can map anything on the right side, and on the left side I can map anything easily reached by my remaining fingers when my left thumb is holding the module key down.</p>

<p>I assigned A-G (home row) keys to F20-F24, which I then use with BetterTouchTool to trigger actions. I also assigned the block of keys from Y-O down to N-. on the right side to produce characters I commonly use in coding, such as curly/square/angle brackets. It took a while to get used to using those instead of reaching for the actual keys, but it does speed things up with a little practice.</p>

<p>Then I added a Fn3 layer, and made it so that when the right bottom button of the module was held, the other two buttons turn into PgUp and PgDown, and B and Space turn into Home and End. This is essentially the same as holding down my (repositioned) right Mod key and using the arrow cluster on my right hand, but gives me easy one-handed left-handed scrolling while my right hand is on the trackpad. I haven’t added anything else to that layer yet.</p>

              </noscript>
            
<p>The top key on the module triggers the Fn4 layer, which simply turns the bottom two keys into <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-["><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">[</kbd></span> and <span class="keycombo combined" title="Command-]"><kbd class="mod symbol">&#8984;</kbd><kbd class="key symbol">]</kbd></span> for forward back navigation.</p>

<p>I’ll expand the Fn3/4 keymaps as I find needs for them, but one step at a time. I’ve made the mistake of programming complex layers (and entire other keymaps) and then having to make extensive cheat sheets to remember where everything is until I develop muscle memory for them.</p>

<p>Bonus tip: The Fn layer by default only affects the number keys, so there’s a whole lot of room for mapping other functions to letter keys. I turn a block of keys on the right to be media controls:</p>

<p>Not so long ago I wrote a little script that would generate an HTML playground of any MacOS app’s menu bar, primarily for the purpose of generating screenshots. It has a full automation API and you can script screenshots with fuzzy name matching, meaning menu items names and positions can change and your automated screenshots will still work. It’s a very specific use case, but I shared it because it took way too much time and I would love it if it helped even one other person.</p>

<p>Yesterday I updated the menu styling to match Ventura, which uses new submenu indicators, slightly smaller font sizes by default, and slight changes to background opacity and hue. The results should look like a passable rendition of the latest operating system now. You can <a href="https://ttscoff.github.io/niftymenu/Pages.html">check out the demo here</a>.</p>

<p>NiftyMenu also got <a href="https://brettterpstra.com//projects/niftymenu">its own project page</a> on this site, with full documentation and installation instructions.</p>

<p>Ever feel like you’re drowning in a sea of emails? You’re not alone. We know the struggle of managing important emails while fighting spam messages with flashy sales. For every 10 emails from sources you don’t even remember subscribing to, you get one important one. When you find it, it feels like you’ve already finished a long task, doesn’t it?</p>

<p>Finding important messages shouldn’t feel like a battle between you and your inbox. In fact, why do you have to sort through all these unimportant files in the first place?</p>

<p>In a world of relentless digital communication, email overload is a common struggle. But SaneBox can help you to conquer your inbox once and for all! Using AI, SaneBox learns your email habits and sorts incoming messages precisely, so you can achieve the ultimate victory: a perfectly organized inbox.</p>

<p>Let’s explore this service in a quick overview!</p>

<h3 id="why-sanebox-stands-out">Why SaneBox Stands Out</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>AI-Powered:</strong> SaneBox’s algorithms learn your email behavior and customize your inbox management experience. So, if you want to see your favorite brand’s discounts in the same inbox as your collaborator’s messages, you’ve got it!</li>
  <li><strong>Personalized Prioritization:</strong> High-priority emails stay in your main inbox, while lower-priority messages move to a separate folder for later review.</li>
  <li><strong>Focus-Driven Features:</strong> With tools like Do Not Disturb, you can pause incoming emails and concentrate on your tasks without distractions. You can come back to them whenever you’re ready.</li>
  <li><strong>Universal Compatibility:</strong> SaneBox works with any email service. So whether you’re using Gmail, Yahoo, or Outlook, you can tame that inbox.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-sanebox-features">Key SaneBox Features</h3>

  <li><strong>Customizable Folders:</strong> Organize your emails effortlessly with custom-made folders for all your categories and priorities.</li>
</ul>

<p>When it comes to pricing, Sanebox is an inexpensive choice. You can get a free trial to experience the difference in email management without any commitment. Plus, the app offers flexible monthly plans starting at just $7. It’s really that affordable!</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://feedpress.it">FeedPress</a> to handle this blog’s RSS feeds. It reads my statically-generated RSS feed and gives me subscriber stats, as well as the ability to send new posts to social media endpoints. But it lacks Mastodon integration, and I’m spending most of my time on Mastodon lately (find me at <a href="https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff" title="Mastodon/ttscoff@nojack.easydns.ca">@ttscoff@nojack.easydns.ca</a>). So I wanted my new posts on this blog to automatically post to Mastodon. The <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/3f545a4e74b46cc80eca2b887ee364a6">script in this post</a> could be used with any blog that generates an RSS feed, but is mostly geared toward static blogs.</p>

<p>I got started with a post from Dr. Drang called <a href="https://leancrew.com/all-this/2022/11/announcing-new-posts-on-mastodon/">“Announcing New Posts on Mastodon”</a>. It included a Python script that I referenced to create a Ruby script for my needs. Thanks to the Doc for getting me started!</p>

<p>You can find the script <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/3f545a4e74b46cc80eca2b887ee364a6">here</a>. See below for configuration and usage.</p>

<!--more-->

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>

<p>To configure the script, at minimum, you need your Mastodon endpoint and an auth key. Your endpoint is generally your Mastodon instance URL with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/api/v1/statuses</code> appended to it, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://mastodon.social/api/v1/statuses</code>. I’m not sure if this is ever not the case. The auth key can be generated by going to your Mastodon homepage, clicking the Settings gear icon, and choosing Development. Create a new application with any name, your blog url as the website, and leave the Redirect URI as is. Make sure it at least has permission to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write:statuses</code>. You’ll then see a client key, a client secret, and an access token. All you need is the access token for this script.</p>

<p>Set up the script by updating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASTODON_ENDPOINT</code> (as described above) and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MASTODON_AUTH</code> (with your access token).</p>

<p>You’ll also need to configure the RSS feed. The script can parse JSON or XML feeds of your blog (local files or URLs) to find the latest post. If you want to use a JSON feed, set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON_FEED</code> to either a local JSON file (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> is fine for your HOME directory) or a JSON feed url. If you’re using an XML feed, set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON_FEED</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nil</code>, and set <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RSS_FEED</code> to either a local file or url. With FeedPress, my JSON is generated from my XML and both feeds can take a few minutes to update, and the most immediate list of posts I have is the local <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">atom.xml</code> file generated with my site, so that’s what I have mine set to. That way I can run this script immediately after a new deploy and still get the latest post.</p>

<p>The rest of the settings in the script are the template used for the status (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">POST_TEMPLATE</code>), an optional query string that can be appended to the URL for campaign tracking, etc. (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QUERY_STRING</code>), and then a few options for updating front matter. I imagine most people won’t need the front matter bit, but the options are commented if you need them.</p>

<p>It records what it posts to a local JSON file (location set with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TOOTS_DB</code>), so it won’t post the same thing twice. Optionally, it can go back and add a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mastodon: [TOOT_URL]</code> key to the original Markdown for the post. I’m using this to render a Mastodon link on each post that links to the toot so that people can reply/share it from their Mastodon account (since Mastodon doesn’t/can’t offer a “Toot This” link the way Twitter can, as far as I know)<sup id="fnref:js"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:js" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. For most people this step is probably unnecessary, and can be disabled entirely by setting the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ADD_FRONT_MATTER</code> constant at the top of the script to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code>.</p>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>All of the necessary config is commented, should be pretty easy to get running. Rather than rely on Ruby’s Net/HTTP library, it just uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> to make the call, so you need a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> binary available (this is default on most systems).</p>

<p>To use the script, save it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toot.rb</code> and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x toot.rb</code> on it. If properly configured, you can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./toot.rb</code> to toot the latest post from your feed. If you want to test, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--debug</code> (or just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-d</code>), and it will set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">visibility=direct</code> parameter that will make the resulting Mastodon post show up only for you (private).</p>

<p>You can run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./toot.rb --last-ten</code> to toot the last 10 posts. Use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./toot.rb -h</code> to see available options.</p>

<p>By default, when the script creates a new toot, it will notify you on STDERR. It will also output <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEW_TOOT: [TOOT_URI]</code> to STDOUT, which is what I use to detect whether a new toot was created and trigger a rebuild. You can disable all output with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--silent</code> (or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-s</code>).</p>

<h3 id="updating-front-matter">Updating Front Matter</h3>

<p>If you want to use the front matter updating “as is” in the script, it requires that your blog posts be named to match the url. It takes the url path, substitutes slashes for dashes, and removes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> and any trailing slash from the url to create the slug, then adds <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>. So if your post is at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://brettterpstra.com/2023/04/21/im-on-shrooms-like-right-now/</code>, the resulting file it will look for is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2023-04-21-im-on-shrooms-like-right-now.md</code>. If your naming scheme is anything else, it would require manual editing to work.</p>

<p>For reference, I have this script run as part of my Rakefile <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:deploy</code> task. Once the site is fully deployed, it runs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toot.rb</code> and toots the latest post. If the script returns <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NEW_TOOT</code> on STDOUT (meaning the post has never been tooted before and the front matter for the tooted post has been updated), it will re-render and deploy the site again so that the Mastodon link on the newest post goes live. Presumably, although that’s about to be tested when I publish this post. It’s a bit of a hacky workaround, but I can’t toot it until the post is live, and I can’t get the Mastodon link until it’s tooted, so it takes twice to get it right. It will only ever toot a post once, so updates and re-renders won’t be doubled.</p>

<div class="language-ruby highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:generate_deploy</span> <span class="k">do</span>

<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="in-closing">In Closing</h3>

<p>I hope that FeedPress eventually adds Mastodon sharing to its social services, but my current setup really likes having the actual URL for the associated Mastodon post available, so that wouldn’t do much good in this scenario anyway. I hope this script is helpful to other people using static blog setups and wanting Mastodon integration.</p>

<p>If you do generate your own RSS feed and don’t currently get statistics from it, I do recommend checking out <a href="https://feedpress.it">FeedPress</a>. It’s affordable, and great for blogs and podcasts.</p>

<p>Again, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/3f545a4e74b46cc80eca2b887ee364a6">find the script in this gist</a>.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:js">
      <p>I considered just using JavaScript to load the JSON record that this script creates and inject a Mastodon link on the front end (avoiding multiple renders), but for a few reasons decided I’d rather add a hardcoded link at render time. <a class="reversefootnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fnref:js">&#8617;</a></p>

<title>Markdown to Bike conversion</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16078222/markdown-to-bike-conversion</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16078222/markdown-to-bike-conversion</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m liking outlining in Jesse Grossjean’s latest app, <a href="https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/bike/">Bike</a>, for my outlining needs. It’s a simple outliner that can save the content of its outlines to Bike files, OPML documents, or plain text. And its native document format is plain HTML that’s easy to work with.</p>

<p>As an aside, Jesse just released Shortcut actions for Bike, making it possible to do some automation of Bike and Bike documents. I haven’t played around with it much yet, but if you’re into Shortcuts, <a href="https://www.hogbaysoftware.com/posts/bike-automate-with-shortcuts/">check out what’s available</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that Bike lacks is an easy way to convert Markdown lists to Bike outlines. It can actually read indented plain text just fine, but the list markers are included in the node text, and blank lines become empty nodes instead of being compressed. Running a list through a Markdown processor and saving as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bike</code> can often create an invalid file, as Bike requires every list item to contain a paragraph tag, not bare text.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I initially played around with running Markdown through a Markdown processor and then manipulating the output, but ultimately went with a much simpler version that compresses newlines and removes list markers, putting the resulting indented text in your clipboard. Pasting the result into a Bike document should almost always yield the expected result.</p>

              </noscript>
            

<p>Save the script below as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">md_to_bike</code> in your PATH and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x path/to/md_to_bike</code>. It can be called as a pipe or on a file. To call it as a pipe, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cat myfile.md | md_to_bike</code>. To call it on a file, just provide the path to the file as an argument: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mmd_to_bike path/to/myfile.md</code>. The results will be placed in your clipboard, ready to paste into a Bike document.</p>

<p>Over 20 years of writing scripts and apps I’ve collected a lot of “snippets” of code that I save whenever I solve a problem and think I’ll want the solution again in the future. I like these snippets to include notes and links, and I need to be able to easily search them and grab the code when I need it without much effort. That’s why I wrote Snibbets <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2020/04/29/markdown-and-code-snippet-management/">back in 2020</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve now refactored Snibbets as a gem and vastly improved its capabilities. I wanted the simplicity of creating snippets in nvUltra and searching them quickly from the command line, getting just the code I need with a few keystrokes. I keep iTerm in Visor mode, so it’s a hotkey away, and just as convenient as any quick find panel in a dedicated snippet management app.</p>

<p>Snibbets now has <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/snibbets/">its own project page</a> where you can read all about its features and options. You can also see all the code, file bug reports, and make feature requests <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/snibbets">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Here’s a quick overview, though.</p>

<h3 id="snippets-are-markdown-files">Snippets Are Markdown Files</h3>

<p>A snippet is just a Markdown file, where the filename becomes the title, optionally with additional extensions that help the syntax highlighter, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">symbolize hash keys.rb.md</code>. The document can contain tags in MultiMarkdown metadata format, titles as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> headlines, additional notes, and the code snippet either indented or fenced with optional language specifier. A single document can contain multiple snippets, separated with headlines as titles for each one.</p>

<p>Snippets all go into one folder. You don’t need to organize them into directories, that would defeat the purpose of the full text search in Snibbets. You can open that directory in any app that can handle it, such as nvUltra or Obsidian, and have full access for editing and creating new snippets.</p>

              </video>
            </figure>

<h3 id="searching-your-snippets">Searching Your Snippets</h3>

<p>To search your snippets, just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snibbets SEARCH TERMS</code>. It will use a combination of Spotlight, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">grep</code> to find matches. If there’s more than one match, you’ll get a menu, and if the selected file contains more than one snippet, you’ll get a second menu. The code from the snippet is output to the console without any accompanying notes.</p>

<p>You can run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--edit</code> to open the selected snippet in your editor to see all of the notes or update the code. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--nvultra</code> to open the snippet in nvUltra, assuming you’re on the beta. You can also run with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--copy</code> to copy just the code to your clipboard in addition to displaying it in the console. Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snibbets -h</code> to see all available options.</p>

<h3 id="filtering">Filtering</h3>

<p>When multiple results/snippets are detected, a menu is generated. If you have <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf" title="junegunn/fzf:A command-line fuzzy finder">fzf</a> installed, it will be used for the menu, allowing fuzzy searching to narrow results. If you don’t have fzf but do have <a href="https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum" title="charmbracelet/gum:A tool for glamorous shell scripts 🎀">gum</a> installed, that will be used and is almost as good for this purpose. Failing that, Snibbets will generate its own menu and you’ll have to enter a number to get the snippet. fzf and gum are far superior, so I recommend installing one or the other.</p>

<h3 id="syntax-highlighting">Syntax Highlighting</h3>

<p>I put a lot of time into syntax highlighting. You can use either Pygments or Skylighting (separate installations), and you can configure the theme. Syntax definitions are picked up from the filename and from language specifiers on fenced code blocks. It looks really great using Skylighting and the Nord theme (as shown in the video above). To enable this, edit your config (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">snibbets --configure</code>) to include:</p>

<div class="language-yaml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight fixed"><code><span class="na">highlight</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="no">true</span>
<span class="na">highlighter</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">skylighting</span>
<span class="na">highlight_theme</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">nord</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Snibbets will avoid highlighting anything going to the clipboard or being piped or redirected to other commands. Keeps things tidy.</p>

<p>It’s a simple tool<sup id="fnref:simple"><a class="footnote" href="https://brettterpstra.com#fn:simple" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but it makes it feasible for me to store all of my code snippets in a way that allows nvUltra to become my main code snippet manager, and gives me instant access to any snippet from the command line. Just what I needed.</p>

<title>Syntax highlighting is fun, and you won't believe this one weird trick</title>

<p>Over the last couple of days I got obsessed with wrangling my code snippet collection, once again. It’s not healthy, but it is what it is. I dug back into Snibbets, a tool for managing code snippets as plain text Markdown files that <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2020/04/29/markdown-and-code-snippet-management/">I started back in 2020</a>. I actually got it to a really good point today, but I’m realizing that it’s getting bloated enough that it needs to become a gem before I’m ready to hype it up. The current version and mostly-up-to-date documentation are <a href="https://github.com/ttscoff/snibbets">up on GitHub</a>, though, so feel free to peek in the meantime.</p>

<p>But that’s not what I’m here to tell you about. In the process of working on Snibbets, I wrote a little routine that could turn a file extension into a programming language name for tagging purposes, and vice versa. It seemed ripe for making a little one-off utility, so I’ve <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/14560a71b86a48b4d895087d3700f516">posted a standalone version to GitHub</a>. I’m going to be using it when I’m doing technical writing and including code samples in languages I don’t usually work with. When you create a fenced code block, you can add a “lexer” to the opening fence, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~~~ruby</code>, which helps most platforms with properly syntax highlighting it. But then I find myself working on someone else’s Terraform code and I’m unsure whether that’s a supported language for syntax highlighting. Now I can just run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lexers.rb terraform</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lexers.rb tf</code> and it will tell me all about it. What the available lexers are, what common extensions are associated with it, you know, the works.</p>

<p>I built this by taking the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pygmentize -L lexers</code> and running it through a few regular expressions to make a parseable data set. Then I took the output of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skylighting -l</code> to add a few more lexers (though those don’t have extensions listed and I don’t know many of the more obscure ones, so that data serves to search for a valid lexer, but nothing else). The script itself just builds a queryable object out of the data and offers a few different ways to get at the data (you can see the whole set at the bottom of the script). The easiest way to use it is like I mentioned above: just pass a file extension or language name to it as an argument and it will give you back the info you need. There’s more documentation in the comments of the script.</p>

<p>Just thought I’d share it! <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/14560a71b86a48b4d895087d3700f516">Check out the gist</a> if you’re interested.</p>

<title>I forgot about the Titlecase API</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16070204/i-forgot-about-the-titlecase-api</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16070204/i-forgot-about-the-titlecase-api</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I made a little web service back in 2015 and somewhere in the following 7 years I forgot about it. I’ve been adding title-casing to various projects and plugins and keep writing new code for it… which was the whole reason I built the API to begin with.</p>

<p>It just accepts a text string and returns an AP titlecased version as plain text. That’s it. No bells or whistles, but if you need to incorporate title casing into a script or a Shortcut or anything else that can make a quick call to the web, it’s a great answer.</p>

<p>Just make a call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://brettterpstra.com/titlecase/?title=the%20text%20to%20titlecase</code>, where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title=</code> contains the url encoded string you want to title case. You can play with it <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/titlecase/test">on the test page</a>, which will also show you the url to use to get the same result.</p>

<p>That’s all. It’s a silly little thing, but if I’ve forgotten about it, I bet everyone else did, too, and it might just be handy for someone.</p>

<title>Just checking in</title>
<link>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16068629/just-checking-in</link>
<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16068629/just-checking-in</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I haven’t been posting much besides sponsored posts and web excursions for a while now. I figured it was time for a checkin for the sake of those who check this blog regularly, and especially for the benefit of those who <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/support/">offer financial support</a> to me and all my projects.</p>

<p>As you probably know, I have bipolar disorder. Most of my project releases and blogging spurts correlate with manic episodes. And manic episodes are bad for me — they result in a severe sleep deficit that is shortening my life. But I’ve been remarkably stable lately, the downside of which is no late night coding/creating binges or the inescapable bursting of ideas that I just have to share with the world. It means I do my job, I maintain and support my commercial software, I fix reported bugs in my free projects, and I go to bed. It doesn’t lead to a lot of fun software releases, blog posts, or new ideas in general. Sleep is good, stagnation kills me.</p>

<p>I’ve recently been realizing that my version of “stable” is more akin to depression. The thing is, I can’t take antidepressants without risking triggering a manic phase, which leaves me in a position where I either have to be depressed, or deal with the life-shortening effects of constant mood fluctuation. But I think I have a potential solution…</p>

<hr />

<blockquote class="warn">
  <p>I removed the meat of this post because it was causing friction with my loved ones. I don’t want my activities to cause any undue harm, so I’ll save further sharing on this topic until everything is… decriminalized.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>So that’s my check-in for now. You can hear more up-to-the-minute updates on my progress (as well as Jeff and Christina’s) by tuning into the Mental Health Corner on <a href="https://overtiredpod.com/">Overtired</a>. I appreciate all of the support (monetary, pull requests, and even just kind emails) that you all have continued to provide for me. It really helps me stay motivated to maintain my 100+ projects and create new stuff!</p>

<title>Find which of your favorite apps are on Setapp, revisited</title>

<guid>https://brett.trpstra.net/link/535/16056931/find-which-of-your-favorite-apps-are-on-setapp-revisited</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Back in 2019 I <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2019/04/22/so-you-got-setapp-dot-dot-dot-make-the-most-of-it/">wrote a little script</a> that would parse your Applications folder and tell you which of your apps were available on <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">Setapp</a>. The goal was to help you figure out which apps you were already using that were also on Setapp, so you could use the Setapp version and direct a little of your subscription fee to your favorite developers.</p>

<p>The script parses the setapps/apps page to see what apps are available, and the markup has changed since I originally wrote the script. Thankfully, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cplater/110138170935239070#.">Chuck Plater</a> updated the script <a href="https://gist.github.com/caplater/96467af7041f34367895b7b1170f5589">in a fork</a> to work with the current markup. I’ve implemented his changes in <a href="https://gist.github.com/ttscoff/70f6dec1fa12d96c8af3f8b5b3b7e14b">the original script</a> and it’s once again working fine.</p>

<p>To use the script, save it to a text file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onsetapp.rb</code>, then run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chmod a+x onsetapp.rb</code> on it. Once you’ve done that, you should be able to execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./onsetapp.rb</code> and get a list of applications you use that are also available on Setapp.</p>

<p>Thanks to Chuck for the fix. I hope all Setapp subscribers will go to the trouble of using the Setapp version of apps they already own, it really does help the developers (and this script makes it easy). If you’re not already a Setapp user, <a href="https://go.setapp.com/stp44">here’s my affiliate link</a> to start using hundreds of apps for $10 a month.</p>

<p>Thanks to Curio for sponsoring BrettTerpstra.com this week!</p>

<p>What if your digital notebook allowed you to create at-a-glance dashboards and checklists using queries to pull in and consolidate information from all across your project into lists, mind maps, or Kanban collections?</p>

<p>We call them <em>Smart Collections</em> and that’s what we’re introducing in <a href="https://zengobi.com" rel="nofollow">Curio 25 Professional</a>, the latest release of our flagship note-taking and brainstorming app for macOS.</p>

<p>Create a new list, mind map, or Kanban stack then specify a query expression. Immediately it will dynamically fill itself with matching figures from across your notebook. A query can be as simple as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">starts soon</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#remind</code> or as sophisticated as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(@george priority&gt;4) or due&lt;2w or #active group:priority</code>.</p>

<p>Even better, these dynamic collections contain <em>live</em> instances of the original figures. Edit an item’s text or change dates, tags, or other meta attributes, and those changes are instantly reflected back to the original figures.</p>

<p>In addition to <em>Smart Collections</em>, Curio 25’s Search shelf has been completely overhauled to support this powerful query language. And the query language itself, also used by Curio’s instant <em>Quick Find</em> feature, has been greatly extended with even more functionality to help you find exactly what you’re looking for.</p>

<p><a href="https://zengobi.com" rel="nofollow">Curio</a>, first introduced almost 20 years ago, is the most advanced notebook application for note-taking, brainstorming, and research. It provides all the tools and functionality you need to be more productive and get stuff done.</p>

<p>New traditional license purchasers can save 20% using the code <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TERPSTRA</code>. <a href="https://zengobi.com" rel="nofollow">Visit zengobi.com to learn more today!</a></p>
